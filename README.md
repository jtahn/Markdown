# Obsidian settings that I changed for this vault
- recording them here in case i need to set this up again
- these are necessary so that images show up when viewing markdown files on github.com; so them emgithub sees them too when it embeds them into anki cards

- these are just so the github folder/file structure is cleaner; mimics my personal obsidian

- settings i accidentally stumbled on, but probly have toggles in the settings
	- when i moved an attachment file, it asked me if i wanted the app to always update the links, and i said yes
	- when i tried to delete a file, i checked dont remind
