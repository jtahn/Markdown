# Obsidian settings that I changed for this vault
- recording them here in case i need to set this up again
- these are necessary so that images show up when viewing markdown files on github.com; so them emgithub sees them too when it embeds them into anki cards

ACTUALLY change the first option to:
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226101435.png)

problem is that (i think its a bug as of 2/26/2024):
when using relative path: if you move files around, it doesnt update the paths 


- these are just so the github folder/file structure is cleaner; mimics my personal obsidian

- settings i accidentally stumbled on, but probly have toggles in the settings
	- when i moved an attachment file, it asked me if i wanted the app to always update the links, and i said yes
	- when i tried to delete a file, i checked dont remind
