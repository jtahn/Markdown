# Explanation of setup

- embedded markdown files
	- very easy to edit in obsidian. in particular:
		- lists with multiple levels of nesting
		- mathjax
		- headings
		- horizontal lines
	- can have multiple people polishing the files, but it doesn't affect people's review schedule
		- polishing is fine, bc main content in the file is unaffected
- 'requiring internet' isn't that big a con, bc i'm basically always connected to internet
	- esp considering this setup will basically only be used for leetcode
- imo: only do this setup for cards where i need a combo of lots of screenies + bulleted text and/or headings
	- aka things where there's multiple different answers, possibly long
	- for my career, leetcode really seems like the only thing that fits this. i don't really think math fits here. bc thing with leetcode is that you do want multiple solutions, bc the interviews apparently like it if you discuss multiple solutions, even if there's a clear "best" one
- it's worth having a dedicated setup for leetcode, bc of how important it is for my career. it's arguably the most important thing.
	- it's central for my first few job hops
	- early part of career is probly the most stressful
	- early part of career might be most important? ie if i have great start, then it makes the rest of career inevitable. idk.
