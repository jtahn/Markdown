# what do i call this folder
- what i have in mind
	- i'm going to want reading cards that cover
		- common/important bugs
		- common refactoring/clean code examples
		- (btw, might realize that i should have separate folders for these..but tbh i don't think so)
			- imo there's a common theme here where i want these cards to be about: as a swe, i encounter an uncomfortable situation; so then i want to know how to 'best' deal with it; ie what techniques do ppl suggest; what patterns have other ppl identified
			- btw meta: whole point of this anki/zotero stuff is: make a file any time i'm uncomfortable with a topic
				- wtf am i saying lol...'uncomfortable' just means 'i dont really understand something'. so ofc im going to make some notes on it, thats what learning is u doofus
	- however
		- refactoring: this likely can be done via book sections (ie fowler)
		- bugs: likely also from book sections?
