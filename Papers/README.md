# reminders
- at some point, need to figure out how i'm going to setup the associated jupyter doc to allow for anki reviews
	- likely can do similar thing i'm doing here...ie on the anki card, embed a github page of the jupyter doc
- already busy enough with thesis and leetcode, so don't spam this rn
	- esp bc even with a ton of tangential bg (ie linalg/dsp/dip/cuda) from math phd, i still have a ton of gaps to fill wrt directly applicable bg (ie ml/ai/cv)
		- aka at the start, this is likely going to be far slower than leetcode (bc so much mathcounts/python bg...and the ug dsa bg actually ended up being enough to efficiently ref clrs/halim/etc as needed)
	- be happy if i'm able to progress at like 1 new paper a month, this summer
	- main focus through s25 should be swe job, bc that's what i can reasonably line up a job for by the time i graduate
	- though i possibly might be able to ramp up to 1 new paper a week...seems i'll be 'done' with most of my leetcode prep by f24..and imo a reasonable expectation is that enough of my ml/ai/cv gaps will be filled by s25
	- so let's say, try to have implemented 50 papers by s26...aka a year after grad
	- ideally i'll be able to trainsition to some sort of industry research role within 2 yrs of graduating
- atm focus on cv instead of nlp, bc my dsp/dip bg might mean less gaps to fill

	- **Replicating papers.** One great way of getting experience doing ML engineering, is to replicate some papers in whatever sub-field you might want to work in. Richard Ngo, an AI governance researcher at OpenAI, has written some [advice on replicating papers](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fRjj6nm9xbW4kFcTZ/advice-on-pursuing-technical-ai-safety-research#2_1__Advice_on_paper_replication). But bear in mind that replicating papers can be quite hard — take a look at [Amid Fish’s blog on what he learned replicating a deep RL paper](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl). Finally, [Rogers-Smith has some suggestions on papers to replicate](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment#How_to_pursue_research_contributor__ML_engineering__roles). If you do spend some time replicating papers, remember that when you get to applying for roles, it will be really useful to be able to prove you’ve done the work. So try uploading your work to GitHub, or writing a blog on your progress. And if you’re thinking about spending a long time on this (say, over 100 hours), try to get some feedback on the papers you might replicate before you start — you could even reach out to a company or lab you want to work for.

	- Computer vision:
	    - Very easy: train an MLP on MNIST.
	    - Easy: train a [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) or another close-to-state-of-the-art model on ImageNet.
	    - Medium: do some basic adversarial attacks and defences. You might want to play with [this](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/) first. You could try out some attacks and defences from [this](https://course.mlsafety.org/readings/#adversarial-robustness) list of papers.
