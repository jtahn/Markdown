- obvi the priority is to do all the standard/fundamental projects
- but maybe have at least one personal silly ML/AI/CV project
	- imo rs3 is probly great for this, bc i have a lot of 'domain knowledge/resources', and i've alrdy scripted a bunch of non-ML bots
		- importantly, alrdy know what is possible with 'simple techniques'
			- identifying certain pixels that can give me info about game/player state based on the color
			- sheeted rotations
		- aka: what is worth trying to figure out 'ML techniques', bc simple tech doesn't work (and it doesn't seem worth learning reverse engineering)
			- in particular: pvm bot for dungeon clears is definitely the hardest
				- if dungeon clears is too hard, then imo do ag or telos

- i'm guessing it doesn't make sense to make a 'mini project that could have real world impact', bc any project that does that is likely arldy being investigated by ppl with actual jobs, on a much more professional scale
	- so if i'm just gonna do 'useless/redundant work', then just do the standard/fundamental stuff...seems better to just learn more efficiently so i can get hired and then do actual professional work


- as i learn more about ml/ai/cv, i can update ideas here

- also, if the actual 'ML' portion of this project ends up being 'easy'
	- then i can start focusing on other/secondary considerations of industry ML (i'll learn what these are)
		- ie maybe, how to use smaller/more 'resource' efficient models?


# questions
- (that will probly get answered as i learn more)
- is it standard to have multiple models for various steps?
	- or should i just have 1 model that handles everything somehow?
- should i look into projects/writeups about self-driving car 'models'/'algos'?
	- bc seems like an rs3 bot should have a similar general structure?
		- cuz i assume self-driving car is an 'algo' that's like...'continuously evaluating/determining state' and then 'determine actions based off state'?
			- well tbh...isn't literally every robot like this?
	- ie there's like 'continuous decisions' to be made?
	- maybe i need to be looking into the 'software' side of robot AI...


# ideas for necessary models 
(asterisks indicate tasks that i have very undeveloped ideas for atm)

## human mouse mvmt
- input:
	- current mouse location
	- desired mouse location
- output:
	- 'human mouse mvmt' from current to desired location
- ideas
	- see that fast.ai project that mapped mouse mvmt recordings to 2d images
		- figure out a reliable 'inverse' function
			- aka from 2d image, generate the mouse mvmt
- data
	- i'll need images for both 'human like' movement
	- the issue here: how should i generate 'bot like' movement?

## boss state detection
- input
	- image of game screen
		- ie image of qbd spawning fire waves; or raksha styles
- output
	- state of boss fight
		- ie the model should output that qbd is breathing fire waves
- data
	- i'll just have to add a lot of labeled screenies of an entire boss fight
		- probly from multiple camera angles
		- easiest way to achieve this is probly: just record my own gameplay, and then extract screenies
- note: some bosses will need much finer states
	- best example is probably kerapac's spear jump
		- it's not enough to know that he's spear jumping
		- my surge/bd needs to occur on a specific tick/angle of the spear
		- and remember when i tried to write a sheeted pixel bot for this, i learned that this specific tick isnt actually sheetable; there's like 2 possible ticks where he executes


## square detection
- input
	- image of game screen
	- state of boss fight
		- ie "qbd breathing fire waves" or "raksha pools"
			- !!! raksha pools means that this cannot be limited to just movement...
			- so i think it's just like, 'important square detection'
				- often, it'll be used for mvmt; but sometimes, it'll be used for target; and maybe other cases as well
				- otoh, raksha pools don't have a square hitbox..so tbh, maybe it shouldn't appy here...maybe i just need a separate model for this...ie 'raksha pools target detection' (bc want to bladed dive a tile as close to center as possible, iirc)
- output
	- square we should move to
		- note: i want the ENTIRE square; not a specific pixel
			- i will have a separate routine that picks which specific pixel to click; likely can just do some kind of 2d normal distribution
			- btw normal distribution should be large enough radius on square so that it allows for misclicks...
				- i need to make sure the rs server receives info indicating that i occassional click the wrong square
				- bc iirc, ppl suspect that jagex isnt really sending that much mouse mvmt data; possibly only sending 'what square did they click' data
				- (it's true this could mean that 'human mouse mvmt' is useless, but i think it's a fun attempt)
				- but this also means: if i do misclick, then bot should 'quickly' then try to click the correct square
					- probly do this with a while loop...aka 'while wrong square was clicked, then generate click pixel again, and move and click pixel'
- data
	- probly just: for each image, label the 4 corners of the square i care about


## ability rotations
- goal:
	- essentially, i want the bot to not have to follow a sheeted rotation
	- bot should prioritize max dps, unless boss state requires a certain ability
		- the latter means: sometimes you don't want to use an ability, bc you need it to be off cd for the next state
- input:
	- image of ability bar
	- boss state
	- boss phase/hp
		- ie wouldn't want to sunshine if about to phase
- output:
	- what ability to queue next


## *camera rotation
- model should tell me:
	- if and how i should rotate the camera


## target detection
- (would allow for a bot that can do dungeon clears)
	- and handle bosses that spawn minions
- input:
	- image of screen
- output
	- outlines and identities of targets
		- (i can have a separate non-ML routine that determines highest priority targets)
		- outlines would then allow me to determine boundary of where to click the highest priority target

## *mob luring
- to line up mobs; ie for:
	- efficient aoe
	- safe spotting
- what should the output be?
	- sequence of clicks?
		- but this isn't exactly it...ie bc second click depends on mob locations after the first click
