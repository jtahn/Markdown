f is cont and diff bc on the interval, bc its cont/diff everywhere

(most of you used the argument: you wrote down derivative and plugged in it.
aka you're using the fact that you can compute the derivative.
aka that the derivative exists.
aka that it's differentiable there)


"satisfy hypotheses" = discuss continuity and differentiability on the interval


mvt only requires differentiability in the interior, ie (0,1); do not need it at the endpoints


derivative of x^{4/5} at x=0

red is $f = x^{4/5}$
purple is $f' = \frac{4}{5} x^{-1/5}$

- only point that really needs to be checked is x=2:
	- can compute that function is continuous
	- for derivative: (review section 3.2)
		- remember derivative is a limit
		- left hand limit: equals derivative of left piece, at/near/left of 2: we get 2
		- right hand limit: equals derivative of right piece, at/near/right of 2: we also get 2
		- so LHS and RHS limits are the same; so limit exists
	- a lot of you tried a shortcut where you: 
		- computed the derivative functions for both pieces, and then plug in 2, and see if they're equal
		- this works, but the reason why is really subtle...


the limit check only really needs to be done for x=2, aka where the pieces meet; at x=0 and 3, you already know the pieces are continuous
