- only point that really needs to be checked is x=2:
	- can compute that function is continuous
	- for derivative: (review section 3.2)
		- remember derivative is a limit
		- left hand limit: equals derivative of left piece, at/near/left of 2: we get 2
		- right hand limit: equals derivative of right piece, at/near/right of 2: we also get 2
		- so LHS and RHS limits are the same; so limit exists
