[1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

#/fundy 
- ppl who use a 2d storage: a common bug:
	- Note to others: when initialising dp in the beginning, doing `dp = [[0] * (len(text2) + 1)] * (len(text1) + 1)` does NOT work because this creates "len(text1) + 1" number of REFERENCES, so updating one array will update everything else. You can try and print the dp array and see for yourself. I found this explanation from the LC discuss section, and didn't realise this in my solution and I was stumped on why my answer was incorrect!
	- (this problem will not be fundy for this issue, bc can use 1d storage)

		- note: the LCS function they define: returns a subseq, not a number; bc they care about finding the actual subsequence
	- here: (inspired by notation from wiki article above)
		- let `S_i` be the zero-index prefex of string `S`
			- ie `S_i = S[:i+1]`
		- let LCSL(X,Y) be length of LCS(X,Y)
		- then point is: `LCSL(X_i, Y_j)` is: 
			- 0 if i=0 or j=0
			- if both `i,j > 0`: 
				- if  `x_i = y_j`:
					- (ie if last chars are matching)
					- `1 + LCSL(X_{i-1}, Y_{j-1})`
						- ie add 1 to subproblem soln
				- else:
					- max of:
						- `LCSL(X_i, Y_{j-1})`
						- `LCSL(X_{i-1}, Y_j)`
					- ie take larger of the subproblem solns

- #/meta i think i need a tag to indicate that a problem is a fundamental/classic problem
	- ehh otoh...most of the problems i do could be considered classic problems...bc they have some kind of key/step idea that it is fundamental for?
		- well not rly...when ppl say 'classic', it's not the same as what i call 'fundy'

	- Note: The longest common substring is contiguous, while the longest common subsequence need not be.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence
	- A longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the longest common substring: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The problem of computing longest common subsequences is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility, and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics. It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.
		- #/fundy i should probly add the following problem, bc it has a key difference:
			- longest common substring/subarray, aka:
				- [718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray/)
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring
		- i should probly  also add the problem where we return the actual subsequence
			- bc this problem only cares about the length
			- doesn't seem to exist on leetcode
				- https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1569988/c-print-longest-common-subsequence-hard
			- but i suspect is essentially same main idea/technique
				- (bc the answer you return, involves returning a LCS)
				- [1092. Shortest Common Supersequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/)
			- imo important bc i'm almost certain you cant do a '1d space optimization ' if we need to return a string; aka we actually do need the 2d table
	- For the general case of an arbitrary number of input sequences, the problem is NP-hard.[1] When the number of sequences is constant, the problem is solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming.
		- #/fundy maybe also add problems for 'arbitrary num of sequences'
			- those algos: imo enough to just be aware of the solution and key ideas
			- do not need to 'memorize' how to code it?

	- nice example+diagrams
	- this seems like a problem where 'reverse iteration' is natural for bottom-up
	- i wonder: from his initial explanation:
		- why can't we do some kind of 'post order' traversal? so that we only fill out the cells that we actually need to 
		- yea see the final diagram at 11:38:
			- post order should be possible: after u get returns from children (aka from bottom and east): we just pick the max and return to parent call
			- but ultimately: can see call stack is at least O(n) space complexity; so no point, bc we can do 1d space optimization anyways; see discussion below
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/1143
	- nvm: for bottom-up, forward iteration is just as natural

- https://interviewing.io/questions/longest-common-subsequence
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#Solution_for_two_sequences
	- seems the 'backtracking/traversal' idea: can only use it for returning an LCS
		- ie to find the actual length...need to fill out the entire 2d matrix for some reason?
			- also see https://aquarchitect.github.io/swift-algorithm-club/Longest%20Common%20Subsequence/
		- (probly not urgent to figure out: bc 1d space is actually possible, see below)

```python
# neetcode
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for j in range(len(text2) + 1)] for i in range(len(text1) + 1)]

        for i in range(len(text1) - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(len(text2) - 1, -1, -1):
                if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j])

        return dp[0][0]

```

## dynamic programming 1d
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#Reduce_the_required_space
	- this is just like the fundy i mentioned in [[62. Unique Paths]]
	- we only need 1d space:
		- bc filling out an entry only requires the directly previous subproblem in each dim
		- so by looping over 1 of the dims, we only need to store a structure corresp the other dim
	- (and this is likely far less spce than backtracking)
	- imo one of the key observations to state here and in robot paths:
		- the underlying space of subproblems is 2d
		- but in implementation: we only need 1d space
			- (aka can remove a dimension by looping over it)
	- i need to figure out if and why: this 1d space optim isn't possible if we want to return an LCS
		- ie what is the key idea that makes it possible for 'only care about length'



```python
# possibly correct 1d storage
def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int: dp = [0] * (len(text2) + 1) for i in range(len(text1) - 1, -1, -1): nextDP = [0] * (len(text2) + 1) for j in range(len(text2) - 1, -1, -1): if text1[i] == text2[j]: nextDP[j] = 1 + dp[j + 1] else: nextDP[j] = max(dp[j], nextDP[j + 1]) dp = nextDP return dp[0]
```
