[733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
```

# Description
An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.

Return _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224222750.png)  
**Input:** `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2`  
**Output:** `[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]`  
**Explanation:** From the center of the image with position `(sr, sc) = (1, 1)` (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.  
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**` image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0`  
**Output:** `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`  
**Explanation:** The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.  

**Constraints:**
- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], color < 2^16`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

## writeup
- add the pre/in/post order traversal stuff
	- maybe go look in CLRS

- I need to figure out in-order?

- for implementations:
	- approach headings should be based on bfs/dfs and pre/in/post
		- ie bfs pre, bfs in, bfs post, dfs pre, dfs in, etc
		- headings will make it very easy to click around and compare structure. so nbd that code isn't next to each other
	- then under the approach: implementation is like:
		- python list, python queue module, recursion, etc



## to fundy
- there are certain techniques that have a lot of variants, and in some problems, there is a specific variant you need to use
	- ie binary search; graph traversal
	- imo the best way to organize this:
		- a card that just briefly goes over all the variants. ie:
			- 'binary search' for binary search
			- 'flood fill' for graph traversal
				- (meta) imo this card is perfect for overview of graph traversal concepts
				- that it's a 'matrix' actually makes things simpler imo, bc now it gives a very good example of how to compute/apply complexity
		- note: this means:
			- all these variants should be doable on this card
			- these cards should NOT explain 'when to use a specific variant', bc this problem is not an example of  it
		- so all these cards should explain is:
			- definitions
			- python implementations of variants
		- and then imo: have a 'TOC' that links specific fundies for explaining the 'why' behind each variant

- the point of this card is essentially to help understand the (implementation) differences behind the jargon
	- bc i'll be able to see in the code: like what 'pre-order' looks like; what a 'dfs' looks like
		- and like differences in the general structure btwn these things
	- then, other cards show WHY you want to choose an implementation



# References
- stack basics
- queue basics
- python queue module
- python: stacks are lists



# Results
## complexity of bfs/dfs on graph
- time O(edges + vertices)
- in particular: O(4N + N), where N is number of nodes


## dfs: stack and recursion are equivalent
- is this actually true? i had some links saved...
	- if not: then this should be moved to 'references for future'


## graph traversal basics
- bfs
- dfs
	- stack
	- recursion
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order
- (and python code examples of everything above)


# References for future
- why bfs vs of dfs
- why pre/in/post order




# Implementations


## BFS pre
- implementations
	- queue (python list)
	- python queue module

## BFS post




## DFS pre

- strategy
	- fill neighbors if they're in bounds and are the old color
	- do this via traversal
		- any of DFS, BFS work
		- it seems any of pre-order and post-order work as well
			- what i mean by this is (idk if this is right jargon): you can 'process' a node before adding it to the structure, or after you pop it
			- ie for recursive, the aux function can either: given a node:
				- "pre-order" (i think)
					- changes its color
					- recursively applies itself to valid neighbors
				- or "post-order" (i think)
					- changes its color if valid
					- recursively applies itself to all neighbors
	- todo:
		- understand why all of dfs/bfs work
		- understand why all of "pre-order"/"post-order" work (if this is the right term for what i'm saying)
- complexity
	- O(nm) time and space (for n rows, m columns)
		- bc DFS/BFS on a matrix
- errors
	- need to check if the start pixel is already newColor
		- otherwise you get an infinite loop
