[733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.

Return _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224222750.png)  
**Input:** `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2`  
**Output:** `[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]`  
**Explanation:** From the center of the image with position `(sr, sc) = (1, 1)` (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.  
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**` image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0`  
**Output:** `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`  
**Explanation:** The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.  

**Constraints:**
- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], color < 2^16`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

- strategy
	- fill neighbors if they're in bounds and are the old color
	- do this via traversal
		- any of DFS, BFS work
		- it seems any of pre-order and post-order work as well
			- what i mean by this is (idk if this is right jargon): you can 'process' a node before adding it to the structure, or after you pop it
			- ie for recursive, the aux function can either: given a node:
				- "pre-order" (i think)
					- changes its color
					- recursively applies itself to valid neighbors
				- or "post-order" (i think)
					- changes its color if valid
					- recursively applies itself to all neighbors
	- todo:
		- understand why all of dfs/bfs work
		- understand why all of "pre-order"/"post-order" work (if this is the right term for what i'm saying)
- complexity
	- O(nm) time and space (for n rows, m columns)
		- bc DFS/BFS on a matrix
- errors
	- need to check if the start pixel is already newColor
		- otherwise you get an infinite loop
