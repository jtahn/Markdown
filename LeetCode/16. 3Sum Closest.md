[16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,0,0], target = 1`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

**Constraints:**
- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

# todo

#/meta 
- this problem doesn’t seem that ‘valuable’ tbh
	- ie it’s fine as extra practice, but doesn’t seem to introduce anything different from [[15. 3Sum]]


#/strats 
- there is a binary search solution, but it’s worse
	- essentially: for each pair, you binary search for value in rest of the array
	- https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/solutions/2677042/java-two-pointers-binary-search-2-solutions/
- i feel like there must be a better solution? feels like even two pointer is leaving out a lot of pruning possibilities
	- to find out…check submissions in the higher percentiles
