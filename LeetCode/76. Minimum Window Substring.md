[76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

```
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
```

# Description
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`  
**Output:** `"BANC"`  
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "a", t = "a"`  
**Output:** `"a"`  
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = "a", t = "aa"`  
**Output:** `""`  
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.  
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.  

**Constraints:**
- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## comparing 2 dicts
- [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md)
	- implementing hashmaps
	- dict comparisons
	- if you're only comparing 2 things: then you can just use 1 dictstructure
		- ie 1vs 2 hashmap


## iterate to make subroutine more efficient
- [567. Permutation in String](567.%20Permutation%20in%20String.md)
- we are kind of forced to iterate in a way where:
	- adjacent iterations are basically same, except one character difference
- otherwise: reconstruction counts for a substring is expensive


## repeatedly comparing dicts: use a variable to abbreviate
- optimization: variable to keep track of freqs / similar tricks
	- so that we do not need to iterate through entire dict every time, to compare equality
- this discussion does not belong in [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md)
	- just doesn't demonstrate at all while it's useful, and it just adds an extra step for that problem
	- ie not natural at all 
	- maybe again use [567. Permutation in String](567.%20Permutation%20in%20String.md)
- tbh..idk if this should be its own result...should be combined with the 'iterate to make subroutine more efficient'
	- bc this is part of how we make the subroutine be efficient
	- but also vice versa: this is useless unless we're iterating a certain way
		- ie if we iterated diff way: there's no guarantee there's a relation btwn variable assigned to one string, and variable assigned to the next string



## overloading data with boolean info
- (what is the correct jargon)
- ie techniques that, incorporate a flag into variables you already use? iirc this is used in the ‘01 matrix’ problem iirc (ie using -1 to indicate, we havent checked this location yet)
	- also can be used in the 'check if unbalanced tree' problem
- benefit
	- save on space complexity
		- typically, only get a better constant
		- but iirc some problems, better asymptotics







# Results

## python: iterables: slicing
- what is returned when you slice an iterable, but same start and end indices
	- ie for string: is it empty string?
- (this is used for ppl who handle ‘no solution found’ without an explicit flag..and just initializing the start/end ‘solution’ indices in a way that ‘incorporates’ the flag
- btw is there general ‘jargon’ for this? 



# todo
## writeup
- move a lot of discussion to "# results"


## to min stack
- this should cite fundy for 'overloading data with boolean info'
- the 'most efficient approach' where what you store in a stack, it's different if it's a new min
	- bc this is like a more advanced version of this


## inspo for sliding window

!!! maybe the 'global iteration' method naturally follows bc:
- we're basically forced to iterate in a certain way, so that the subroutine is efficient

- still doesn't seem like 'global iteration' is that natural though...
- maybe this problem is like:
	- 'real idea underlying 2 pointer', is just understanding what parts of the search you can immediately skip, if you've found a valid solution
- ie maybe:
	- for problems that are: 'find extrema over search space'
	- assume you have found a 'valid element'
	- then: what parts of the search space can you now skip
		- ie: even if its valid: it wont be solution bc its not an extrema?



---

- I feel like there is a 2 pointer intuition here...but it would be forcing it..
- general idea:
	- first find a window on left side that contains substring
	- then we start the 'iteration'
- tbh this is like 2 pointer, but it's like more advanced/general
- wait no this is not right..this isn't 2 pointer


yea this is NOT 2 pointer!! there is something else going on here
- like i'm sure there's a way to make 2 pointer makes sense, but it's definitely forcing it
- imo key idea will come out of focusing on this: '2 phases' idea


maybe it is 2 pointer..but this would be an example of where: sometimes, there isnt really a 'natural' global iteration method that precedes it

---


ohhh!! I also think there's an idea like:
- instead of checking all substrings
- lets only check substrings of valid substrings
	- so now try to think about, how you perform this efficiently
	- (there's surely many other ways to implement this)
- ie general idea being:
	- only check for solutions among 'valid subsets'
		- 'valid subsets' isn't the best term here..bc 'set of all substrings of a valid substring', not all these substrings are valid




## handling no solution
- probably not worth explaining what happens if you dont find a window
	- figure out the ‘standard’ ways to handle it
		- flag variable? i initialize as solutionFound = False
			- and only flip the bool if we exit phase 1 / enter phase 2 at least once
		- if window start/end is still at a ‘default/invalid number’
	- in code, at most a brief comment: ‘# if no solution’

- handling ‘no solution’
	- so many ‘implementation variants’ that are essentially identical
	- std approach 1:
		- initialize start,end=0
			- instead of ‘end’: can also do ‘window length’
			- can also initialize stuff to a sentinel/infinity value
		- only update start and end/length when a new best solution is found
			- (valid window)
			- less than current max window, or no window found yet
		- (a few std ways to handle: ‘no window found yet’)
			- if end/length = 0
			- or if one of the vars sentinel/infinity
			- (for both above approaches: seems you can choose whether to run this check either inside the main loop, or outside when you return answer)


- start/left = -1; and/oror length/right/end = 0
	- means that ‘no solution yet’ needs to be checked inside the loop
- length/right/end = infty
	- means that “no solution yet” needs to be checked when you return a solution
		- ie if var is still at sentinel value
	- because inside the loop: infty means that a solution will always have length less than the ‘initialized length’






# Implementations

## check all substrings
- implementations
	- brute force


## only check substrings of valid
- implementations
	- sliding window


#### Sliding window


2 hashmaps
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240316003153.png)

- observation
	- we call a substring 'valid' if all the target letters have been found in the current window
	- two pointers: start and end to mark of the window
	- alternate between the following
		- phase 1: shift end/right pointer until window is valid
			- note: if this phase never ends, then a solution doesn't exist, ie return an empty string
		- phase 2: shift start/left pointer until window is invalid
			- update minWindowLength if necessary
	- pf of why this works (aka why we can ignore states)
		- (todo)
- implementation
	- all approaches
		- need variables that keep track of left index where the min was achieved
	- 2 hashmaps
		- valid letter count iff `count_s[c] >= count_t[c]`
	- 1 hashmap
		- essentially the same, it's just you 'invert' relations
		- initially set it to the counts of t
		- as you slide through s:
			- decrement counts during phase 1
				- aka as you add letters to window
			- increment counts during phase 2
				- aka as you remove letters from window
		- valid window iff all counts in the hashmap are `<= 0`
			- so phase 1 until the above happens
			- and phase 2 until there is a letter count that is `>0`
- complexity
	- time O(m+n)
		- O(m) to build counts for the smaller string
		- O(n) to iterate/slide through the larger string
			- at each step, we move one of the pointers to the right
	- space O(1)
		- hashmap is size of the alphabet/character set
- python implementation of hashmap
	- dict
	- default dict
	- Counter
- ways to do dict comparison
	- `s_count & t_count == t_count`
		- the `&` operator on counters returns the intersection
- optimization so that you don't need to do a iterate through the hashmap(s) to comare/check validity
	- have a variable that keeps track of frequency
		- either directly: how many chars we have found/missing so far
		- or indirectly: how many chars in the alphabet satisfy the 'valid' condition
			- aka have the correct frequency
- other base cases could manually add (tho seems, not necessary?)
	- if len(t) > len(s): return ""
- (todo) figure out good way to explain how to handle what happens you dont find a substring
