[876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151128.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[3,4,5]`  
**Explanation:** The middle node of the list is node 3.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151136.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`  
**Output:** `[4,5,6]`  
**Explanation:** Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

# todo

#/anki 
- card where you spot the error in python code:
	- accidentally overwriting a built-in name as a variable
		- ie defining a `sum` variable


#/strats 
- note that it is also correct to initialize fast as `fast = head.next`
	- is it possible that this actually aligns more with the strat/idea?
	- (the idea being...we should focus on 'steps', not 'nodes')

## #linked_lists/fastslow

	- i'm sure someone has something, check halim
- i think this should be it's own tag..seems that for linked list:
	- not only is 'use 2 pointers' a common trick, but in particular, a slow and fast pointer:
		- each while loop iteration, slow moves once and fast moves twice
		- aka implementation: typically just move both simultaneously; instead of one after the other
			- #/research are there problems where you can't implement this way? ie where you have to move one first, then check something, then move the other, and then check something?


- i think i should just memorize the while conditions, bc this seems like a classic/standard way to loop this
	- (later, figure out if the 'even/odd num nodes' info should be something that is generalized, or is info that really is only useful to this problem)


- what do we know when the while loop ends?
	- aka inspecting `while fast and fast.next:`
	- note: fast always takes 2 steps, and it starts on the first node
		- so it always is on the 'odd' node (1-based indexing), if it exists
	- so when loop ends, either fast=None
		- so fast is 'after' the last node
		- aka even number of nodes
	- or fast is fast.next=None
		- so fast is the last node
		- aka odd num nodes

---

- here: obvi you should use fast and slow
	- mainly need to think about the even case: making sure slow ends up on the second middle

- maybe inspo:
	- from the odd node case: just doing a practice run, it's clear that the code will work
	- for the even node case:
		- 'implicit list': imagine the 'after last' node as an actual node
		- then by odd case: the slow node ends on middle of this 'implicit list'
			- which is second middle of the 'og list'

- i think more rigorous inspo actually requires:
	- split into even/odd cases, and in each case analyze:
		- use num nodes to determine num iterations for fast to cause break
		- use num nodes to determine num steps we need slow to take
		- show that num iterations == num steps
	- (also this inspo seems like it would generalize a bit easier..probly indicates this is better way to think about it)


# Strategies


## fast and slow
- complexity
	- space O(1)
	- time O(n)



```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
		# btw don't actually need this base case
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next

        return slow

```
