Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.


```
class Solution:
    """
    @param: strs: a list of strings
    @return: encodes a list of strings to a single string.
    """
    def encode(self, strs):
        # write your code here

    """
    @param: str: A string
    @return: decodes a single string to a list of strings
    """
    def decode(self, str):
        # write your code here
```


**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `["lint","code","love","you"]`  
**Output:** `["lint","code","love","you"]`  
**Explanation:** One possible encode method is: `"lint:;code:;love:;you"`

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `["we", "say", ":", "yes"]`  
**Output:** `["we", "say", ":", "yes"]`  
**Explanation:** One possible encode method is: `"we:;say:;:::;yes"`


**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.
	- Your algorithm should be generalized enough to work on any possible characters.
- Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.
- Do not rely on any library method such as `eval` or serialize methods. You should implement your own encode/decode algorithm.

# 'prepend lengths'
```
class Solution:
    def encode(self, strs):
        res = ""
        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s):
        res = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != '#':
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            i = j + 1
            j = i + length
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i = j
            
        return res
```



- observation
	- if you use delimiters, then you have to worry about if the delimiters are actually used in the string...this seems like a nightmare..either impossible, or need lots of escape characters or complex parsing logic
- strategy
	- prepend each string with the length of each string, in a consistent manner
		- aka add a header that represents the length of each string
		- so concatenated encoding will look like: `header-payload-header-payload-...`
	- question: how to determine whether we're reading the length vs the string itself?
		- option 1: delimiter (example above uses `#`)
			- as long as delimiter is never used in the header, then this is fine bc you know:
				- if you haven't seen the delimiter yet (ie if you keep getting digits), then you're still reading in the length
				- the first time you see delimiter, this is the delimiter btwn length and actual string (bc length itself doesn't have the delimiter)
			- this is probably the better/more flexible solution, bc works for unbounded length for strings
		- option 2: fixed-width
			- works here bc there's an upper bound on length of the string
			- specifically: bc length at most 200, we know that 3 characters/digits is enough to store the length
				- (tho the example below uses 4 characters)
			- this avoids ambiguity: since the length prefix is fixed-width, there is no confusion about where each string starts and ends
			- if you use this method: will need pad out the header when length isn't 3 digits
				- use `{:3}.format(len(s))`
			- then when you decode, it's as simple as
				- `size = int(s[i:i+3])`
- complexity (let n be combined/ttl length of all strings)
	- O(n) time
		- bc for both encode/decode, need to iterate through count n characters
		- ? bc of python appending operations (for encode) and iterating through a string (for decode)
	- O(n) space
		- ? bc you have to construct a new string / array of strings
