[322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `11 = 5 + 5 + 1`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `coins = [2], amount = 3`  
**Output:** `-1`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `coins = [1], amount = 0`  
**Output:** `0`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

#_research 
- this is a really subtle problem imo
	- wrt complexity analysis
	- lots of tradeoffs, see my initial thoughts below
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem
	- before i cleanup my thoughts...look at refs first...this is a very famous/standard problem
	- seems #knapsack is a very important and large class of problems i should look at

	- (a lot of these are out of scope for leetcode; but ideally at some point, i just want to be aware of the main use cases of each..ie 'abstract problem description'; i don't actually need to know how to implement it, bc i wont have to in an interview, bc they'd never ask...but on the job, maybe this will one day come up, and it'd be nice to be aware of it immediately...so then i can go and implement it)

## #dynamic_programming 
- ok so dp is really just about identifying:
	- how to compute f(n) from subproblems
	- ie which subproblems are required
	- and thus, what 'fixed space' we need to store subproblem solutions
		- note that 'fixed sized space' doesn't mean `O(1)`
		- bc here, the fixed space is size `O(n)` where `n` is size of max denomination
		- WAIT...no this is def not optimal; constraints say denomination value can be max int value
			- well size of this space is also bounded by `amount`
			- either way, space complexity here is required to be linear in either amount or max denom (whichever is smaller)
- subproblems:
	- to get `f(k)`, we need to know `f(k-i)` for all coin denominations `i`
	- this means that the 'fixed size stuff' we need to store:
		- let `n` be the max denomination
		- we need to maintain all of `f(j)` for `j` in `[k-n, k-1]`
			- even tho not all these values are used to compute `f(k)`, they are needed to compute later solutions, ie `f(k+1)`
			- but the moment we compute `f(k)`, we don't need `f(k-n)` anymore
		- issue of this approach is that you're constantly re-arranging this array (to replace values) or traversing a linked list (depending on how you decide to store subproblem solutions)
			- well u could do arithmetic so that re-arranging isn't necessary...ie use indices that wraparound the array
		- major issue is space is very high...see above...aka backtracking probably worth knowing

# Strategies

## #backtracking
- neighbor with highest priority is the largest unprocessed coin
- lots of pruning you can do
	- prune trees that's alrdy using same/more coins than curr best solution
	- prune trees where curr sum is alrdy over target


- todo:
	- check complexity percentile of bottom-up solution: i highly suspect it will do poorly wrt space
	- aka i think backtracking is definitely worth understanding/knowing here
	- actually maybe not..backtracking likely has large space complexity as well in the worst case...bc have to go down recursion tree
		- actually can think of examples wheres one of these approaches has terrible space complexity and other doesnt
		- ie if you only had a penny, then backtracking will use huge space, but bottom-up uses only 1 entry
		- but if you had all denominations from penny to 'billion dollar coin' and the target was 'billion dollars', then backtracking does far better




## top-down with memoization
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9bfqozjoqs&list=PLPe9IkX86X3y5m_MvtNu2ughxsvkqUNKr&index=106
	- neetcode is doing like a combo of backtracking + memoization
		- he doesn't really discuss all the pruning you can do
		- 


## bottom-up


```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for a in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1

```
