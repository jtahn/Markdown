[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
```

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`  
**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `nums = [3,3], target = 6`  
**Output:** `[0,1]`  

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)` time complexity?

# todo
- jargon
	- is it “collisions”?

# results
- existence ‘back-checking’
	- check for existence only on stuff you’ve already iterated over
	- versus naive/brute methods: check for existence on everything
	- specifically:
		- using sets to check collisions with records we’ve already visited
	- note: lots of implementation variants
		- ie often, there are 'inverse/symmetric' options:
		- ie 2sum:
			- store num; check for target-num
			- or store target-num: check for num
		- ie sudoku:
			- tuple or string
- use dict instead of set, when 'existence of collision' isn't sufficient, need more data about it
	- ie 2sum: need index of where collision occurred
- python tricks
	- (todo add this)
	- checking for membership testing and adding to set at the same time


- hashing basics
	- set/dict key lookup / membership testing can be implemented for O(1) time
		- in python, this is indeed the case
		- in other languages, need to be careful about what structure you use
			- ie in java (or maybe it was c++), one of the ‘commonly used structures for hashing’ isnt actually O(1) membership testing



# Brute-force search
- strategy
	- check all pairs
- complexity
	- O(n^2)  time
	- O(1)  space

def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    found = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        a = nums[i]
        if target-a in found:
            return [i, found[target-a]]
        else:
            found[a] = i
    return
```
- observation
	- use dictionaries to store bijections/inverses/pairs. specifically:
		- `dictionary[number] = "its index in the array"`
- strategy
	- for num in nums:
		- check if `d[target-num]` exists
			- aka if `target-num` is a key
			- aka has been encountered
		- if not, store where we encountered `num`
			- aka set `d[num] = index`
- complexity
	- O(n)  time
	- O(n) space
