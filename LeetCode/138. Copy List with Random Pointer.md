A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110551.png)  
**Input:** `head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]`  
**Output:** `[[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110605.png)  
**Input:** `head = [[1,1],[2,1]]`  
**Output:** `[[1,1],[2,1]]`  

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110615.png)  
**Input:** `head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]`  
**Output:** `[[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]`  

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

- strategy ( 2 passes)
	- First Pass - Node Creation:
		- for each node, create a corresponding new node, and store the mapping in old_to_new.
		- Step 1 is to loop through the linked list and make a copy of each node, we will place the nodes into a hash map with the original node as the key and the created node as the value. We do this for O(1) access later.
	- Second Pass - Setting Pointers:
		- For each node, set its corresponding new node's `next` and `random` pointers based on the hash map.
		- Step 2 is to loop through the linked list a second time, this time knowing that all the nodes have been created, we can access the nodes inside our hash map, and then set our pointers.
- variant (1pass)
	- (we are going to have to be careful to make sure we are reusing any node that has already been created, and creating nodes that don't exist.)
		- can simply be done though by using a hash map again for O(1) access to see if the node exists, and then creating the node if it doesn't exist
		- making sure at each iteration of our loop, that the nodes in question exist 
		- we check if the node as been created before, if not create it and put it in the hash map, with the key as the original node, and the value as the created node. Note that we are looping only through valid nodes, so while for our current node we don't need to check if it is a null node, we will have to handle null node cases for our next and random nodes.
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space
		- for hashmap

- key idea
	- The trick to solve this problem in O(1) memory is to use duplication trick.
	- interleaving copied with original, will make it O(1) to update the random pointer in the copied nodes
		- bc you go: original -> original random -> copied random
		- kind of like a 'transitive' property
		- 
- strategy
	1. Iterate through the original list and create a copy of each node, insert the copied node directly after its original node. This links the original and the copied nodes in a single mixed list. 
	2. Go through the mixed list again and set the `random` pointers for the copied nodes. Since we've interleaved the copied nodes with their corresponding originals, each original node's `next` is now its copy. This makes it easy to find and set the copied node's `random` pointer: if `originalNode.random` exists, then `copiedNode.random` will be `originalNode.random.next`.
		- i.e. via `curr.next.random = curr.random.next`
	3. Finally, we need to restore the original list and separate the copied list from it. We iterate through the mixed list, re-establish the original `next`links for the original nodes, and create the `next` links for the copied nodes.
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- 3 O(n) = O(n)
	- space
		- O(1) if you don't count the output
- fun facts
	- might be like "dna replicating itself"

- note: the input list is completely messed up btw...need to add some code if you want input list to be preserved at end of the routine
	- (todo: confirm that the code i have above, is actually 'destroying' the og list? if it's still preserving it, then below code is the same...)
