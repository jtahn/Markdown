[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
```

# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153115.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153126.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

## #trees/traversal 

- the idea here is just:
	- do 2 traversals at the same time
		- 1 each for left and right subtrees
		- check that at each step, both traversals match 



- #/fundy 
	- base case for trees:
		- seems often: case where node is none
			- ie NOT node is leaf (aka children are none)
			- i think bc easier to implement?


#/fundy
- the conditions inside the function, are just verifying that we have a match at this step of the traversals. the most sensible progression for the conditions:
	- base case: both none:
		- return true (bc they match)
	- 'second' base case: ('can we even do a curr node comparison')
		- (return false) one of the nodes is none
	- 'curr node comparison case'
		- (return false) the nodes aren't same val
	- 'now do child calls'
		- recursion: typically incorporate these in the return statement
		- stack/q: add children
- (i feel like there's definitely a template here...for 'traversals' on trees)


## #ad_hoc 
#/jargon 
- idk where this goes
	- bc i don't think this is strictly a traversal concept
	- it's not even strictly a 'recursion' concept either, bc u have essentially same consideration when doing iterative approach
- it's kinda like 'num calls vs num inputs'
	- but this isn't precise either...bc when i say 'num inputs', i'm talking about 'num nodes'; not other inputs for 'aux structures'
	- also 'num calls' isnt accurate for iterative approach; there, it's "num pushes"

---

- point of this fundy (in the recursion jargon)
	- really understanding difference btwn:
		- what you to input to recursive calls
		- what you call the recursive function on
- and there's exact parallels to iterative approach:
	- needing 2 stacks/queues is EXACTLY why ur recursive function needs 2 nodes as input
	- adding 2 nodes to each stack/queue is EXACTLY why ur recursive function makes 2 recursive calls


### recursion scenario/jargon

- as usual for traversal on trees, we do a 'similar process on both children'
	- call recursive function twice, on each child of the involved node

- the twist: why recursive function takes 2 nodes as input
	- bc 2 traversals: so the call takes 2 inputs
	- and traversals need to be MIRRORED, which is why we pair opposite children
		- (ie 'mirror' is what they mean by 'symmetric')


- the fact that we are looking for 'symmetric/mirrored' is what allows for the incredibly clean code:
	- can start the recursion with root as both parameters
- but also means inefficiency? #/think
	- bc seems the root call makes 2 recursive calls that are verifying the same thing


# Strategies


## 2 simultaneous traversals



```python
# recursion (inefficient bc 2x work?)
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root1, root2):
            if root1 is None and root2 is None:
                return True
            if root1 is None or root2 is None or root1.val != root2.val:
                return False
            return dfs(root1.left, root2.right) and dfs(root1.right, root2.left)

        return dfs(root, root)


# iterative dfs
# (pretty sure, just change queues to stacks)
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:



# iterative bfs
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return True
        queueLeft = deque()
        queueRight = deque()

        queueLeft.appendleft(root.left)
        queueRight.appendleft(root.right)

        while queueLeft and queueRight:
            nodeLeft, nodeRight = queueLeft.pop(), queueRight.pop()
            if not nodeLeft and not nodeRight:
                continue
            # both node must exist
            # if exists thet must have the same value
            if not nodeLeft or not nodeRight or nodeLeft.val != nodeRight.val:
                return False

            queueLeft.appendleft(nodeLeft.left)
            queueLeft.appendleft(nodeLeft.right)

            queueRight.appendleft(nodeRight.right)
            queueRight.appendleft(nodeRight.left)
        return not (queueLeft or queueRight)
