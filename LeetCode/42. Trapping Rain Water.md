[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

```
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224212822.png)  
**Input:** `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`  
**Output:** `9`  

**Constraints:**
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

## kadane's: basics
- one-way max can be done in one pass
	- pre-compute with array
	- pointer for on the fly






- ie: ‘max to the left’ can be computed with array/pointer computing from left to right
	- ‘max previous’ can computed with a forwards pass
	- ‘max future’ computed with a backwards pass

- iirc the problem to cite here is whatever used kadane's
	- [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](121.%20Best%20Time%20to%20Buy%20and%20Sell%20Stock.md)
	- iirc there was another problem as well..that one might be better



- what is the jargon for one-sided max?

- strategy
	- computing the left and right global maxes for a coord: can actually do this check at the beginning for all coords in one pass
		- create arrays `left` and `right` to store the one-sided global maxes at each coord
			- ie `left[i] = max(height[0:i])`
		- forwards pass to determine global max lefts
			- at each node, global max left is the highest height encountered so far
		- backwards pass to determine global max rights
	- after you create these arrays: now iterate through coords again and compute total water





## 2-pointer via alternative iteration
- tbd: do I specifiy: 'flipping order of loops' or 'iterate over different quantity'
	- or do i just keep as 'alternative'


- meta: why this should be a reference and not a result
	- this is not the best fundy for this problem
		- bc the way you get to the alternative iteration, is not straightforward at all
	- i'm looking for a problem where it's much more 'immediate' that you can iterative in a diff way
		- ie that actually has nested loops that are straightforward to 'flip'/change order
			- btw...is there even a 2-pointer example for this scenario? i don't think i've seen one yet....
			- also this problem...see discussion below, but imo you can't actually interpret it as 'flipping nested loops'...bc there aren't actually nested loops imo
		- and/or diff quantities to iterate over




~!!! should be much more clear what this result should be, now that i have the kadane/pointer/nested loop thing above


---

- possibly: 2 pointer via switching order of loops
	- compare with 2 pointer via:
		- iterating over different quantities
		- changing iteration direction
	- tbh..I dont think this is actually switching loops
		- std is: 'for index, find maxes'..so there's only 1 loop
		- alt is probly like: 'for max, find possible indices'..so there's only 1 loop as well
		- it really is just iterating over different quantities 

- maybe the idea here is like: notice the quantities we iterate over are like 'question' (index) and 'answer' (maxes)...so this is like [739. Daily Temperatures](739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md), where the idea is...can you instead iterate over 'answers'?


---

- future pattern:
	- one way 2 pointer often seems to happen:
		- see if you can ‘flip the way you iterate’
		- this might require adjusting the routine inside the loops
			- example: for 42: the inner loop would now be, ‘for every index’
			- 2 outer loops would be: ‘for every left max; for every right max’
			- and note: the inner loop ‘for every index’: it wouldnt make sense to execute a computation for every iteration here; so you need to adjust stuff
			- but point is: the stuff you CAN execute a computation: it’s actually so limited, that you can skip most all but 2 of the iterations/checks
			- wait yea, this is exactly the point! so many iterations can be thrown out, when ‘for every index’ is the inner loop



- wait!!
	- maybe the idea is: you ‘flip’ the order here:
		- brute/dp: for each index, compute left and right max
		- 2p: for each left and right max: if we can compute an index, then compute the index
			- ohhhh...maybe this is the ‘global iteration’ behind it!!!
			- and by iterating this way: we see how to ‘toss iterations’
			- yes!! point is:
				- for this problem: you actually can always compute one of the index; aka the index corresp to whichever one is smaller
				- aka if you have pointers at left and right, and we know the left max of L and the right max of R, then we already know min LR for either pointer L or pointer R.
				- aka wlog, if the left max is less than the right max computed so far, then we don't actually have to compute right max anymore, because right max can only increase, for the index at left pointer
			- this global iteration is easy, bc the left and right max: dont need to store an array for anything:
				- updating l and r, just depends on prev max and the curr value you just read











# Results


## compute global quantity via local contributions
- (stuff in this heading is too wordy rn)


- example using this problem:
	- for each index, compute water trapped at that index



- for ‘water trapped on/at index’ approach:
	- is it too obvious to mention: ‘if minLR < height’, then nothing is trapped?
	- probably tbh..this will be evident in the code, bc it’ll be like max(0, minLR-height),
		- or better: just have an if statement:
			- if minLR - height > 0: add trapped to ttl
	- ‘water is trapped if there are strictly larger heights on both sides; and amt is the lesser of the two heights’
	- imo simple comment should just be: ‘# if water is trapped at this index’
		- and its clear, the condition is: minLR - height >0 
	- then just set variable:
		- amtTrapped = minLR - height
	- (aka very readable code: no prose needed)


- how to compute:
	- at coord `i`, if water is trapped, then the amt is `min(L,R) - height[i]` where:
		- L,R are heights of global maxes to the left and right
			- ie `L = max(height[0:i])` and  `R = max(height[i+1:])`
		- at boundaries, one of the maxes is 0 (bc no heights on one side); so our formula still works, bc can't store any water here

## kadane's: pointers are nested loops
- (meta: this should probably be a reference)


- !!! 2-pointer is actually combining dp idea as well; or rather, the idea underlying dp
	- you first have to know that: pointer for each nested loop
	- this is what makes it 'natural' to iterate over maxes
	- and as for why this would be worth looking into: you save space complexity

- recall from basics: pointer or array
- for each pointer, you add a nested loop
	- equivalently: for each direction you want to do on-the-fly (aka don't precompute): you add a nested loop
	- aka if you want to remove nested loop: then need to pre-compute and store in an array


- maybe this should be more general....'pre-computing removes nested loops'
	- but this makes it sound like nested loops are a negative...when complexity wise, wouldn't it always be a positive? bc it reduces space complexity
	- the only 'con' seems to be 'uglier' code...but that's subjective..tbh, nested loops are arguably cleaner, when the nesting is only 2 levels like here


# Implementations


## on index, std iteration
- implementations
	- brute force
	- dp



```
# brute force





# DP

```



### Brute force
- strategy
	- for each coord
		- find global max height to left and right
		- compute formula in observation, and add to running total if the amt is positive
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
		- we iterate over each bar
		- for each bar, we iterate over array to find the global maxes
	- O(1) space





### Dynamic programming


- add code for DP
	- likely dont need to explain much, its fairly obvious, esp after the brute force approach



- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space


## on index, alt iteration
- implementations
	- nested loops via kadane's
	- 2-pointer


```
# nested loops


# two pointer
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax, rightMax = height[l], height[r]
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                res += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
```





### Two pointer
- observation 1
	- recall that to compute water trapped at a coord, we need `min(L, R)`
	- let `LM = max(height[:l])` where `l` is a left pointer in the array
		- "global left max encountered so far", according to the pointer `l`
	- it turns out that from just `LM,RM`, we can determine `min(L, R)` at one of `l,r`
		- wlog suppose `LM <= RM`. then at `l`, we have
			- `L = LM`
			- `R >= RM`
				- `RM` has not visited all heights to the right of `l`
				- so `R` could be among the unvisited heights
			- so `L = LM <= RM <= R`
			- in terms of the arrays from DP solution, what we are saying is that:
				- the array `right` is monotone decreasing
				- that is, if `i < j`, then `right[i] >= right[j]`
				- so `left[i] <= right[j]` implies that `left[i] <= right[i]`
		- (and similar arguments for rightPointer)
- observation 2
	- `LM, RM` can be stored/computed with just 2 pointers as we go along; ie we dont need a full array 
	- because `left[i]` can be computed from `left[i-1]` and `height[i-1]`
- strategy
	- based on `LM,RM`, choose a pointer `l,r` for which we can compute the trapped water
	- after computation, move the corresp pointer (and update the corresp currMax)
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- we only traverse the array once
	- O(1) space
		- only current pointers and current left/right maxes


## left of index
- implementations
	- stacks

```
CODE
```


- actually this is very simple idea:
	- for each wall, compute water trapped strictly to the left of it (ie this wall is the right wall)
	- the idea is that there is an efficient way to do this; avoid double counting;
		- actually uses 2 ideas:
		- via tracking ‘useful left walls’ (stored via a stack) and keeping track of ‘current floor’
	- (aka stack isnt about storing ‘walls where we computed right area’; bc note, we actually never do this tbh...)


- store all heights/walls where you have not computed the full area of water where this is the left wall
	- note: you have not computed full area until you meet a height that is larger
		- (probly convert this to an IFF statement)




- key idea 1:
	- computing left and right areas

- key idea 2:
	- ‘oneliner’ options:
		- managing double couting
	- explanation
		- keep track of current floor
		- this tells you: what areas have you already computed, for stuff in the stack
	- implementation
		- 2 main ways:
			- top of stack is always floor
			- external ‘floor’ variable



- for each wall: compute all water trapped to its left (not on top)
- then the wall becomes the new ‘floor’

- if wall is greater than current floor:
	- then there is water trapped to the left of it
	- floor is just: the previous wall

- so stack stores:
	- all walls where you have not computed water trapped to the right
	- key idea: computing water trapped to left: exactly corresponds to walls that you have not computed ‘water trapped to right’



- stack solution for this problem:
	- strategy:
		- for each wall, we compute left area
		- we use a structure to keep track of walls where you can compute left area
		- these are exactly walls where we have not finished computing the right area
	- what we store:
	- ‘whether right wall has finished computing areas yet’
	- (observe: this forces equivalence: we are using a decreasing stack)

ok now that i know about stacks, i should be able to do this
see [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](84.%20Largest%20Rectangle%20in%20Histogram.md)


note: alternatively, stack should just have indices; bc then `height[x]` is the height at that index

![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226113644.png)



diagram of how we want to approach problem:
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226115903.png)


- intuition for main logic
	- when you meet an increasing height: to determine trapped water involving this new height, you don't need every height on it's left that's lower; you only need the strictly INCREASING monotone sequence of heights as you pass to the left
		- aka corresp to a stack that is monotone DECREASING if you consider walls as you pass to the right
		- imo it's easier to understand what's going on by looking at code


- similar to "84 largest rectangle in histogram"
	- todo: understand why stacks are optimal there; ie why you cannot use 2 pointer solution (optimal here) in that problem
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space
- intuition
	- the brute/dp/2p approaches
		- the idea was figuring out what the VERTICAL area of water is, at an index
	- versus this approach:
		- figuring out how to characterize HORIZONTAL areas of water at a node: one way is:
		- first note: don't do a computation at every node. have to figure out when you decide to do a computation
			- aka when water is trapped
		- at each index, fill out horizontal areas of water to the left of it
		- ie if you look from left to right: water gets trapped once an increasing height appears; as more increasing heights appear, you get more water trapped, so the problem here is how to deal with duplicate computations
			- do this via stack; ie point of stack is to prevent duplicate computations; ie only keeping track of decreasing heights that you havent computed with, somehow
	- decreasing stack
		- basically you will use this to fill 'horizontal' areas of water
		- stack needs to store indices, bc trapped water computation depends on 'width'
	- iterate over nodes from left to right
		- while new height is greater than top of stack
			- pop off the stack, and compute the wide area of water
		- once new height is smaller than top of stack, just append to stack
- errors
	- i don't think increasing stack can work here
		- bc the idea is: if you have an increasing stack, then some sort of computation needs to happen when you meet a height that is LESS THAN top of stack, and then you KEEP POPPING stuff off the stack until this height can be put on top of stack
		- but the problem is: after the first pop: there's possibly no water computation to do with the next height you pop: bc both heights are going to be less than the first height you popped; like they could corresp to completely disjoint bodies of trapped water, if that first pop is the global max height
