[127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

```

# Description

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s_1 -> s_2 -> ... -> s_k` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `s_i` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `s_k == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`  
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

## #/tbd 

- this is a great example of modeling/thinking of a problem as a graph, then using a graph algo
	- see skiena's discussion

- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/epi.pdf#page=373&offset=-115,621,0|epi, 19.7 Transform one string to another]]
	- 2 ideas
		- first: can think of the wordList as a graph:
			- vertices = words
			- edge btwn vertices (words) if they have exactly 1 character difference
		- then: bfs on this graph gives a solution
			- aka shortest path on undirected graph


## #graphs/traversal/structures  
- summary
	- it is redundant to construct a graph representation if all you need is a traversal
	- the only structures required for a traversal: 'visited nodes'
		- 'discovered nodes' doesn't seem to be necessary for bfs bc your loop will handle this
		- 'discovered nodes' probly necessary for dfs: either explicitly via stack or implicitly via call stack
- note:
	- constructing a graph already requires a traversal
		- ie for each word/vertex you look for the words/neighbors to add as edges
		- so there's no point doing this if all you need is the traversal itself
		- aka observe: a routine to 'find neighbors' is all you need for traversal
			- (and maintaining a structure tracking what you've already visited, and also possibly for what you want to visit next)

## #/tbd 
- finding neighbors of a word
	- 2 choices:
		- try every 1 char diff (aka for each place in the string, try a diff letter), check if its in `wordList`
		- for each word in `wordList`, check if it's off by 1 char
	- abstract versions
		- for each possible neighbor slot, check existence in population
		- for each possible member in population, check if it's a neighbor
	- it will just depend on the problem, which way is more efficient
		- ie here: the first option is at most `26*10=260` things to check
			- note: its NOT `26**10`
			- the second option is up to `5000` things to check once 

- note: the second abstract formulation:
	- i don't think we can use the #hashing/collisions optimization of 'only check with stuff we've alrdy iterated over'
		- bc point is, we're trying to find new things to visit
		- #/meta i'm now thinking that the 'only check with stuff we've iterated over' should be turned into it's own tag/fundy; maybe moved to the #iteration section; ie split the 'collisions' fundy up
	- ie cannot optimize/rephrase this as: 
		- for each possible member in 'alrdy built city', check if it's a neighbor





# Strategies

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0

        nei = collections.defaultdict(list)
        wordList.append(beginWord)
        for word in wordList:
            for j in range(len(word)):
                pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j + 1 :]
                nei[pattern].append(word)

        visit = set([beginWord])
        q = deque([beginWord])
        res = 1
        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                word = q.popleft()
                if word == endWord:
                    return res
                for j in range(len(word)):
                    pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j + 1 :]
                    for neiWord in nei[pattern]:
                        if neiWord not in visit:
                            visit.add(neiWord)
                            q.append(neiWord)
            res += 1
        return 0
