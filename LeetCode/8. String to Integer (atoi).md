[8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:
1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123" -> 123`, `"0032" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be clamped to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be clamped to `2^31 - 1`.
6. Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**
- Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
- **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "42"`  
**Output:** `42`  
**Explanation:**  
```
The characters before the caret are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "   -42"`  
**Output:** `-42`  
**Explanation:**  
```
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.
```

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = "4193 with words"`  
**Output:** `4193`  
**Explanation:**  
```
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

# todo

- at some point, maybe understand the actual implementation and see if there's anything useful to mention/copy

- `str.isdigit()`

## #/tbd

- i feel like the point of this problem is:
	- know some basic string processing
	- confirm that you are carefully reading the directions/requirements
		- here, the requirements being a specific sequence of steps/algo kind of mean:
			- you can't really do anything else, other than exactly follow the steps
		- and so this basically forces to 'read and construct from left to right'

## #errors/overflow 
- note: shouldn't be in an issue in python
	- Python only uses big integers, it is part of specification


## #dfa 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton
- https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/798380/fast-and-simpler-dfa-approach-python-3/
	- the comments seems to imply that this is a classic and great example of when to use dfa
	- similar idea
		- https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/1526619/Another-Python-3-solution-using-a-state-machine/
	- i should probably understand this one too? uses a 'state matrix'
		- https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/4705/my-java-solution-based-on-dfa/
- btw LMAO, this reminds me of what i saw when i read tutorials about coding some basis osrs bots
- seems the major benefit is that:
	- states seems to make it very easy to deal with edge cases and transitions
		- also makes it very easy to update/modify if you want to change the algo


# Strategies

## exactly follow directions
- strat
	- read and construct from left to right, exactly based on conditions/steps
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/8
		- iteratively build integer from left to right
- is this required, or is this considered an optimization?
	- subroutine that detects if integer is already big enough to clamp
		- so then no need to read in more chars
	- the above should likely considered to be required, bc of #errors/overflow reasons
		- ie cannot do: only run the 'clamp check' once, at the very end, after fully reading in the integer
	- well actually: maybe i should have both, and mention that both work in python
		- but then 'checking for clamps' should probly be done anyways, bc it's an 'optimization'

- note: maybe don't use strip:
	- s.strip(" ") will assign a copy of the string to another variable using O(N) extra space so I would just check manually


- nice trick in the code below:
	- Why check this in the if statement for min/max_num?   `curr_digit > 7`
		- it's bc the bounds are 7 digits:
			2^31 = 2147483648  
			2^31 - 1 = 2147483647


```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        MAX_NUM = 2 ** 31 - 1
        MIN_NUM = -2 ** 31
        
        # trim the leading white space first
        s = s.strip()
        sign = 1
        index = 0
        num = 0
        if not s:
            return num
        
        if s[0] == '-':
            sign = -1
            index += 1
        elif s[0] == '+':
            index += 1
        
        while index < len(s) and s[index].isdigit():
            curr_digit = ord(s[index]) - ord('0')
            if num > MAX_NUM // 10 or (num == MAX_NUM // 10 and curr_digit > 7): # here we do the check before adding current digit
                return MAX_NUM if sign == 1 else MIN_NUM
            num = num * 10 + curr_digit
            index += 1
        
        num = sign * num
        return num    
```
