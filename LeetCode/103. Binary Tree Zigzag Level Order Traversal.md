[103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
```

# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153743.png)  
**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`  
**Output:** `[[3],[20,9],[15,7]]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `root = [1]`  
**Output:** `[[1]]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `root = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

#/strats 
- i think this problem needs to spend a good amt of time finding optimal solutions
	- there's a trivial bfs solution
	- but:
		- dfs would be better space
		- 'optimized bfs'...i don't think it's better space, but should be better time constant, bc don't have to reverse a list?
		- deque is a solution if it's somehow the correct type...
			- i suspect it's not, but somehow the test cases don't resolve this?


- there should definitely be a strat where you build the actual structure in order
	- aka don't need to reverse stuff after you build it
	- so the 'zigzag' affect which direction you iterate
	- surely someone has a clean/clever implementation of this as well, bc involves switching up whether we add left or right first
- there seems to be a deque solution; i'm confused how this is correct though
	- example
		- https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/solutions/998895/python3-bfs-deque-and-dfs-deque/
	- bc isn't deque the wrong type?
		- ie the problem wants us to return a list of lists...not a list of deques
		- and i don't think deque extends the list type...bc random access isnt O(1)
			- https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque
			- https://realpython.com/python-deque/#accessing-random-items-in-a-deque
				- yea it definitely doesn't extend; deques don't support slicing
	- btw that example is interesting, bc there's also a dfs solution


#/anki 
what does this do:
```python
left = 1
left ^= 1
```

it's important to be able to read the bitwise operators, bc seems ppl who are used to C/java will use them, bc they were (at least historically) more efficient
but when i actually code: try to use python's non-bitwise versions 

wait actually: ok if i'm writing 'python standard library code', then it seems i should definitely use non-bitwise if possible

but numpy overloads the bitwise operators as well...and i suspect, i should def use them ...bc then routines will occur using the underlying efficient numpy/C routines? instead of in 'python'

ok at the very elast, important to know...i'll figure out later if it's important for ML/AI, when i see if people use it in code

## tbd
- to manage which way you want the solution:
	- bc it's alternating two choices, then standard approach is:
		- track 'level', and mod by 2
			- ie
				- https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/solutions/3203437/easy-python-bfs-beats-97-8-in-runtime-and-94-5-in-mem-usage/
				- https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/solutions/3203820/python-c-simple-solution-using-bfs-iterative-manner-using-queue/
	- interesting alternative (see nc repo):
		- have a flag that flips btwn -1 and 1
			- clean code, but i wonder if this means it always creates a new copy
		- that this is 'better' for this problem...seems pretty adhoc...
			- is pretty adhoc for this problem...it's only specifically bc the two actions we want are 'same list' or 'reverse list'
		- actually maybe this trick can often generalize?
			- the point is: the flag itself is not just to indicate what type of level; but it's also used for the action on that level, which allows for shorter code
