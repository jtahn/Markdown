[148. Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the list after sorting it in **ascending order**_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151713.png)  
**Input:** `head = [4,2,1,3]`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,4]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151722.png)  
**Input:** `head = [-1,5,3,4,0]`  
**Output:** `[-1,0,3,4,5]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `head = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

## assorted for 'straightforward' adapated merge sort



#sorting 
- step 1: determine what optimal sorting algos are viable here
	- ie that we can implement via 'fundamental linked list subroutines'
- step 2: the 'clear choice' should be merge sort
	- #/research(go check that none of the other main optimal sorting algos are viable)
	- bc: we have subroutine to find middle of a linked list
		- [[876. Middle of the Linked List]]
	- can use pointers to store head, tail of list
- step 3: implement/adapt merge sort for linked lists


---


- implementation details for picking 'head of right half'
	- aka why we pick `slow.next` instead of `slow`
	- if your 'find mid' routine is identical to 876
		- then this routine is finding the middle (if odd) or second middle (if even)
	- so the 'optimal' choice for the head is `slow`
	- so why do we pick `slow.next`?
	- bc: we need to set `left_tail.next = None`
		- otherwise, when we recurse to find mid in the left half, the routine will be incorrect: it will keep traversing into the right half
	- this means:
		- if we want `slow` to be the head, then our subroutine to 'find mid' needs to be modified to also give us the node before slow
		- this isn't hard to implement...but it is extra work, so we just do the 'suboptimal' choice of picking `slow.next` to be the head
			- bc it won't matter for asymptotic complexity, and probly barely affects the constant as well


- implementation details for merge step
	- common use of dummy node
		- when we want to ultimately return head of a list, and the conditional for determining head, is same as conditional inside the iteration
	- cur to track current end of merged list
	- appending rest of nodes after one of the lists is exhausted
		- this is the `cur.next = left or right`
		- clean use of #python/objects_as_booleans 
        



- if list has length `0` or `1`, we do not do anything, it is corner case of our recursion.


# Strategies

## 'top down' merge sort

- complexity
	- O(nlogn) time (standard d&c analysis)
		- log n levels of recursion
		- at each level, we spend O(n) time
			- finding mid of each sublist
			- merging halves
		- in particular:
			- even tho here (linked lists) it is far more expensive O(n) to find mid (compared to O(1) for arrays)
			- this does not affect complexity bc we already spend O(n) time to merge
			- so adding O(n) time to find mid, doesnt increase asymptotics
	- O(logn) space
		- depth of recursion stack

### all in one function

```python
class Solution:
8    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
10        if head is None or head.next is None:
11            return head
12
13        # find mid
14        slow, fast = head, head.next
15        while fast and fast.next:
16            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
17      
18        # split
19        right = slow.next
20        slow.next = None

		# recurse on halves
21        left, right = self.sortList(head), self.sortList(right)
22      
23        # merge
24        dummy = ListNode()
25        cur = dummy
26        while left and right:
27            # attach smaller
28            if left.value <= right.value:
29                cur.next = left
30                left = left.next
31            else:
32                cur.next = right
33                right = right.next
34            cur = cur.next
37        cur.next = left or right    
38      
40        return dummy.next
41
```


### separate functions


```python
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next: return head
        mid = self.getMid(head)
        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(mid)
        return self.merge(left, right)
    
    def getMid(self, head):
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        mid = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        return mid
    
    def merge(self, head1, head2):
        dummy = tail = ListNode(None)
        while head1 and head2:
            if head1.val < head2.val:
                tail.next, tail, head1 = head1, head1, head1.next
            else:
                tail.next, tail, head2 = head2, head2, head2.next
    
        tail.next = head1 or head2
        return dummy.next
```
apparently more readable merge function for the above:
```python
def merge(self, head1, head2):
    dummyHead = tmp= ListNode(None)    # in the original, the var is called tail but its not a tail. its just a temporary var to link nodes.
    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val < head2.val:
            tmp.next = head1    # Link the nodes
            tmp = tmp.next     # in the the original, this line was confusing. But we're only moving this pointer forward.
            head1 = head1.next     # advance the pointer
        else:
            tmp.next = head2
            tmp = tmp.next
            head2 = head2.next

    tmp.next = head1 or head2      # one of the lists has finished. Link the node to the other head
    return dummyHead.next
```

- basic idea/walkthrough of example:
	- imagine that we have list `[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8]`
	- Let us first sort values in pairs:
		- `(a1, a2)`, `(a3, a4)`, `(a5, a6)`, `(a7, a8)`
	- then we sort values in groups by `4`, merging our pairs:
		- `(a1, a2, a3, a4)`, `(a5, a6, a7, a8)`
	- finally we merge them in one group of `8`
