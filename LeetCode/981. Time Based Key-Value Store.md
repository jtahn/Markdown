class TimeMap:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:

```

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:
- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns `""`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
```
**Output**  
```
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]
```
**Explanation**  
```
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100`
- `key` and `value` consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
- `1 <= timestamp <= 10^7`
- All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing.
- At most `2 * 10^5` calls will be made to `set` and `get`.

1. As we need to find the values corresponding to a key: `HashMap` would be the choice
2. We need to find those values whose `timestampPrev <= timestamp`. i.e. means we need to store all the values of a key of different timestamp. Since we are looking `timestampPrev <= timestamp` then keeping those values sorted would make sense. Note, we don't need to maintain the sorted order as `timestamp` is always in increasing order


- note
	- read example 1 to see how this is supposed to work
	- there's nothing that special; just use a hashmap where the "value" is really a list of pairs `(value, timestamp)`
		- so the constructor `TimeMap()` and method `TimeMap.set()` are very straightforward
		- only 'work' here is implementing binary search for `TimeMap.get()`
	- the constraint says "All the timestamps `timestamp` of `set` are strictly increasing", so this is another big hint for binary search for `get`
- variants
	- could use 2 dicts to store timestamps and values separately
		- there's no need to sort the timestamps (bc problem/constraint says you alrdy receive them in sorted order); so index of timestamp corresp to index of its corresp value
- strategy
	- Create a hashmap to store key, value pairs. Here the value timestamp value with acutal value which is stored in another Object of class Element Whenever get used for a particular element we will be going to get all the values of corresponding key and binary search the list of timestamps
	- `get`: This operation retrieves the value associated with a key at a specific timestamp. The catch here is that if the exact timestamp doesn't exist for that key, we need to provide the value with the closest previous timestamp. If there are no earlier timestamps, it should return an empty string.
		- To understand it better, imagine you are building a history tracking system for document edits. Each time someone edits a document, you record the new version of the document with a timestamp. Later, someone might want to see a version of a particular document at a particular time. If a version is not available at the exact time requested, you show the latest version before the requested time.
		- in the `get` function, where you're asked to retrieve a value that is the closest to, but not greater than, the given timestamp. This is where binary search comes into play. The list of (timestamp, value) pairs for each key can be considered as sorted by timestamp. Using binary search, we that the closest previous timestamp to the given timestamp without going over it.
- complexity
	- time
		- The `set` method has a time complexity of `O(1)` for each operation, as it appends the `(timestamp, value)` tuple to the list corresponding to the key in the `defaultdict`.
			- if timestamps werent increasing, it would be worst case O(log n)
				- ie that key, has every pair associated with it
		- The `get` method's time complexity is `O(log N)` for each operation, where `N` is the number of entries associated with the specific key. This is because it performs a binary search (`bisect_right`) to find the position where the given `timestamp` would fit in the sorted order of timestamps stored.
			- `O(log k)` for `get`, where `k` is the length of the list corresponding to the key. In the worst case where `k == n`, the complexity becomes `O(log n)`
	- space
		- The space complexity is `O(K + T)`, where `K` is the number of unique keys and `T` is the total number of `set` calls or the total number of timestamp and value pairs. This is because all values with their corresponding timestamps for all keys are stored in the `defaultdict`.


- python tricks
	- can use defaultdict
	- bisect
		- The binary search is implemented using the `bisect_right` function from Python's `bisect` module, which returns the index where an element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. We search for a tuple where the first element is the given timestamp, and the second element is a dummy character chosen to be larger than any possible value (in this case, `chr(127)` which is the last ASCII character). If `bisect_right` provides a non-zero index, we step one index back and return the associated value. If the list is empty or the index is 0, it means there are no valid timestamps before the given timestamp, and as per problem description, we return an empty string.
		- Notice that `bisect.bisect` is actually synonymous to `bisect.bisect_right`, meaning that it returns the index of the first element that is strictly greater than the requested value. Therefore, you need to use `idx - 1` when indexing.
