[212. Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        
```

# Description
Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227115707.png)  
**Input:** `board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]`  
**Output:** `["eat","oath"]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227115718.png)  
**Input:** `board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are unique.

## when to use pre-order



## (tbd) ‘pre-order requires dfs at every possible starting point’
- Word search 1 -
	- https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/
- this problem only asks to find one word
- optimal soln:
	- at every node, initialize a dfs backtrack search
- see
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/79
	- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0000-0099/word-search-medium

- i suspect:
	- can’t really avoid running dfs on every node
	- There isn’t really any redundant work
	- I think essentially/generally because: it’s a ‘pre-order’ traversal to determine where to go
		- so indeed, you do have to initialize a pre-order search at every node
		- (Compare to diff problem where: if you initialize a post-order at every node: then very likely, could instead just initialize a single post-order populated with the leaves)






# Results

## two search spaces
- the board is a search space
- but now: the ‘set of words’ is a non-trivial search space as well
	- in word search 1, we just had 1 word, so it was trivial
- The ‘brute’ algo is:
	- For every word and for every node, initialize a dfs

## tree/trie: optimizing redundancy wrt pre-order
- the optimal algo here:
	- traverse both spaces more efficiently
	- in particular, where are we doing redundant work
		- (Cite word search 1) can’t avoid searching/dfs at every node
		- but we can improve searching the words
			- we still require pre-order traversal of words
			- But redundancy will happen if words share the a prefix
			- Using a trie will address this
- there seems like a general idea here:
	- Can use a tree structure to deal with ‘redundancy of prefixes’
	- And a trie is the classic example of this


## trie: when a TrieNode should have a value attribute
- here: bc we want to remove word from tree if we find it
	- But we don’t want to remove a char/prefix if a different word uses it
	- So here: we use a value that counts how many words use this char/prefix
