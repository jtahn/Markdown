[1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/)

```python
class Solution:
    def jobScheduling(self, startTime: List[int], endTime: List[int], profit: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420002938.png)  
**Input:** `startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]`  
**Output:** `120`  
**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first and fourth job.  
Time range `[1-3]+[3-6]`, we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420002948.png)  
**Input:** `startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]`  
**Output:** `150`  
**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job.  
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420002959.png)  
**Input:** `startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]`  
**Output:** `6`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4`

	- imo the key step here is sorting all the jobs by endtime
	- then it kinda makes it obvious:
		- how to use dp
		- to use binary search to efficiently find the nontrivial subproblem
			- the 'trivial' subproblem being the previous entry of the dp array


#/move 
- imo this is a really a dp variant, with a focus on how to 'modify'/'clean up' ( #/jargon) the input to make it amenable to dp

7        jobs = sorted(zip(end_times, start_times, profits))

10        number_of_jobs = len(profits)

13        dp = [0] * (number_of_jobs + 1)

15        # Iterate over the jobs.
16        for i, (current_end_time, current_start_time, current_profit) in enumerate(jobs):
17            # Find the rightmost job that doesn't conflict with the current job's start time.
18            # Use binary search for efficient querying. 'hi' is set to the current index 'i' for optimization.
19            index = bisect_right(jobs, current_start_time, hi=i, key=lambda x: x[0])
20          
21            # Update the DP table by choosing the maximum of either taking the current job or not.
22            # If taking the current job, add its profit to the total profit of non-conflicting jobs.
23            dp[i + 1] = max(dp[i], dp[index] + current_profit)
24      
25        # Return the maximum profit which is the last element in the DP table.
26        return dp[number_of_jobs]
