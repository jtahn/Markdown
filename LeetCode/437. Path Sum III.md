[437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals_ `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153842.png)  
**Input:** `root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The paths that sum to 8 are shown.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22`  
**Output:** `3`  

**Constraints:**  
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`

## #backtracking 

- confirm: a common approach to problems that ask for 'return number of ways':
	- figure out: how do i 'immediately know' that i should try backtracking, and not dp
		- imo: it's because there's no like 'end'/'largest'/'final' problem
			- ie not really any obvious subproblem structure? (versus on arrays, usually a lot more obvious)
		- or maybe:
			- bc here, we can directly compute a node's contribute to the final answer
				- like each node can help increment the variable that we will actually return at the end
			- versus most dp solutions, it was like: we don't actually 'increment the number for final answer' until the last subproblem


- does this 'idea' come before 'prefix sum'?
	- i think so...
	- first you decide you want to use backtracking
	- so then imo, this implies that you want to be able to compute 'answer contributions' at a node
		- aka, path sums that end here
	- so now you need to think about: what info you need to be able to compute path sums that end here
		- as well as what info you need to provide to future nodes; and to update the 'info'
	- and thus, what structures


- backtracking bc the 'move' is: add currsum to prefix counts
	- you make move before dfs call; then unmake after the call comes back


## #prefix_sum 

- 'prefix sum' (idk if correct jargon)
	- aka sum of a path that starts at root (but can end anywhere)
- suppose we're at a node, and we know `currSum` (aka path sum from root)
	- if we also know all the prefix sums possible on the path to this node
	- then we can compute all path sums that end at this node (not necessarily starting at root)
		- bc they are just the collection of `currSum - prefixSum`, for all possible `prefixSum`

- note we care about counts: so we should actual store counts of the prefixSum
	- and so we care about the count of `curr - prefix = target`
		- aka `curr-target = prefix`
	- that is, check `count[curr-target]`


- importantly:
	- via currsum, we can maintain correct counts of prefix sums during backtracking


solution update:

Check if the current running sum (`s`), minus the `targetSum`, exists as a key in the `cnt` dictionary, which is a Counter of prefix sums. If it does, that indicates there are prefix paths that, when removed from the current path, yield a suffix path that sums to `targetSum` (i.e., `ans = cnt[s - targetSum]`).



make move
Before continuing to child nodes, increment the count for the current sum in the `cnt` dictionary to reflect this sum has been reached.



unmake move:
1. As we backtrack (after visiting a node's children), we decrement the count of the sum in our Counter to ensure that it only reflects sums for the current path.


!!! key:
In the `pathSum` function, we initialize `cnt = Counter({0: 1})`. This is important because it accounts for the path that consists only of the node itself if the node's value equals `targetSum`.

---

i feel like adding curr val to curr sum should be part of the make/unmake move?
so then: dfs probly shouldnt take curr sum as a paraemeter, and just modify it (aka 'nonlocal' var iirc)

but the difficulty/subtlety here is that...the 'computation at node'..it has to happen btwn 2 of the 'make moves'...cuz you update currsum first, then compute answer contribute, then you add to counter...seems odd that the 'make moves' can't be grouped together



#/jargon in backtracking, what do you call the step where you 'do a computation on this node' that isn't part of make/unmake move?


# Strategies




## backtracking via prefix sums


- complexity
	- time `O(n)`
		- visits each node exactly once
		- constant work at each node
	- space `O(h)` (so worst case O(n) for skewed tree)
		- recursion stack: O(h)
		- counts: at most O(h) unique prefix sums along a path


- implementations
	- dfs returns part of solution
	- probly also: dfs modifies 'nonlocal' var for the solution

```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        def dfs(node, s):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            s += node.val
            ans = cnt[s - targetSum]
            cnt[s] += 1
            ans += dfs(node.left, s)
            ans += dfs(node.right, s)
            cnt[s] -= 1
            return ans

        cnt = Counter({0: 1})
        return dfs(root, 0)
```
