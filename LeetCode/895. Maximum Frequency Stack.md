[895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/)

```python
class FreqStack:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        

    def pop(self) -> int:
        


# Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = FreqStack()
# obj.push(val)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
```

# Description

Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:
- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
    - If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**
```
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
```
**Output:** `[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]`  
**Explanation:**
```
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= val <= 10^9`
- At most `2 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push` and `pop`.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop`.

# todo

#/cite
- check halim, where he discusses combining techniques/structures...i think the last chapter of book 2
- maybe clrs is good here too: augmenting data structures?

#/style 
- use the #ad_hoc  tag also for problems that:
	- (no need for an 'induction' tag, bc i'm always inductively learning...that's the whole point of reviewing/revising)
	- atm, the ideas here are too intertwined for me to split into headings/fundeez/tags
		- often: strat seems so specific to this problem
	- so come back to this later for when i build up more bg
		- ie seen more examples/concepts

- the #/cite tag to indicate: there are probly refs that i should cite here


#/jargon 
- is this a #design question?
	- operations/functionality motivate the structures
	- but probly...it's just easier to see/memorize tons of design examples



#/fundy 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Specialized_heaps
	- [Monotone priority queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_priority_queue "Monotone priority queue") are specialized queues that are optimized for the case where no item is ever inserted that has a lower priority (in the case of min-heap) than any item previously extracted. This restriction is met by several practical applications of priority queues.

#/meta 
- adhoc problems are valuable imo bc:
	- surely situations where: realize you can equate your problem to an 'adhoc problem' that has an incredibly beautiful/efficient solution
		- only possible if you've seen the problem/trick before
	- aka example of a major 'concept' in problem solving:
		- being able to formulate a problem in a way that you can use a strat you already know 
		- i mean, tbh this is THE concept

# References

## #priority_queue/multiple_priorities 
- general strat: heap of tuples
	- uses the fact that python sorts tuples lexicographically
	- element is last entry of tuple
	- use aux structures as needed to determine what values (aka keys for sorting) are put earlier in the tuple
- yes apparently this tech is standard
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25232722/priority-queue-with-two-priority-values
- see
	- #python/modules/heapq 
		- negative vals for maxheap
	- #python/builtins_sort 
		- lexicographically sorts tuples/lists/strings (sequences?)
	- standard aux structures to manually compute common keys (for sorting)
		- time: use a var
			- only need to be access/modify/use on push (ie when elt is added)
			- always increments on push
		- counts: use a dict

- here: heap of tuples (count, time, element)
	- count: determined via hashmap
	- time: use a var for global timestamp


## #ad_hoc 

- maybe: something like #sorting/bucket_sort is most related to the inspo here
	- it's true you're not actually sorting anything
		- but the idea of 'buckets' really feels like the inspo
	- similarly:
		- imo the true implementation of the 'inspo':
			- use dynamic array of stacks
		- dict is just arguably more convenient to use



- observe that priority based on 2 levels, and specifically:
	- level 1: count (most frequent)
	- level 2: time (most recent)
- beautiful trick: use structures:
	- dict of stacks
		- key is count
			- aka first priority
		- value is stack
			- aka second priority
	- var indicating current max count
		- so we quickly know where in dict to pop
		- strat 2




- i suspect, it does not generalize well
	- ie specifically because the levels are (count, time) in that order
	- versus the 'heap of tuples' approach, seems like it generalizes so easily to any number of priority levels and types


# Strategies


## counter + maxheap

- O(log n) time complexity of push/pop
- O(n) space complexity
	- ie if all unique elements


```python
class FreqStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cnt = defaultdict(int)
        self.q = []
        self.ts = 0

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.ts += 1
        self.cnt[val] += 1
        heappush(self.q, (-self.cnt[val], -self.ts, val))

    def pop(self) -> int:
        val = heappop(self.q)[2]
        self.cnt[val] -= 1
        return val
```





## counter + dict (count to stack)
- O(1) time complexity of push/pop
- O(n) space complexity


```python
class FreqStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cnt = defaultdict(int) # collections.Counter()
        self.d = defaultdict(list)
		self.mx = 0 # track max count

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.cnt[val] += 1
        self.d[self.cnt[val]].append(val)
        self.mx = max(self.mx, self.cnt[val])

    def pop(self) -> int:
        val = self.d[self.mx].pop()
        self.cnt[val] -= 1
        if not self.d[self.mx]: # check if stack at max count is empty
            self.mx -= 1
        return val
```
