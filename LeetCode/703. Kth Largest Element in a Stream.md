[703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)

```python
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        


# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
```

# Description
Design a class to find the `kth` largest element in a stream. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Implement `KthLargest` class:
- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of integers `nums`.
- `int add(int val)` Appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `k^th` largest element in the stream.

**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
```
**Output**  
```
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
```
**Explanation**  
```
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= val <= 10^4`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `add`.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least `k` elements in the array when you search for the `kth` element.

# Results


## #trees/heaps
- spirit of the problem: the data is being streamed in
- so imo this is really the only 'optimal' approach you can use
	- and only other 'approach' should be brute force



# todo
- confirm that this is the 'fundamental problem' for understanding heaps
	- key aspects that make it fundamental:
		- you're streaming in the info (so quick select wouldn't be appropriate)
		- both min and max heap might work, and problem allows discussion of tradeoffs
	- things to discuss in the 'fundamental problem for heaps'
		- discussion of python heapq module
			- how to implement both min and max heaps
			- using a custom key comparison function (like a lambda function)
			- alternative: pre-compute keys and store them in an array
				- aka if you're okay with using more space
					- this won't increase the asymptotic space complexity, if other parts of algo use linear space as well
				- or maybe keys are a lot of effort to compute, so you don't want to constantly do this on the fly
	- (if not..then find a "fundamental problem", and move everything i just mentioned above to it)
- using min or max heap
	- seems problems that can use one, can also use the other, but there will be a diff in space complexity?
	- ie, in [347. Top K Frequent Elements](347.%20Top%20K%20Frequent%20Elements.md)
		- build max heap, pop k times   
			- so this probly could be size O(n)
		- build and stream through a size-k min heap
			- so this is size O(k)
- python discussion about heapq module, don't forget to mention
	- heapq.nlargest()
	- for max heap: need to invert keys, bc heapq module implements a min heap

# Approaches

## heaps



```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        # minHeap w/ K largest integers
        self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
