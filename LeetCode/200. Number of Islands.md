[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**  
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**  
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**  
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

- strategy
	- step 1
		- 'plan to start' a traversal at every node
			- #/jargon/traversal what is jargon for 'plan to start'
		- every traversal that actually gets 'initiated' will signify a new connected component
		- skip a traversal if we've already visited a node
			- use a 'visited' structure
		- i think the idea here is that:
			- a traversal will explore the entire connected component
			- aka this probly a fundy for the relationship btwn 'traversal' and 'connected component'
	- step 2
		- space optimization: don't need 'visited' structure
			- #array/traversal/storing_visited_nodes_in_place

## traversal basics
- [733. Flood Fill](733.%20Flood%20Fill.md)
- this is basically just flood fill
- it's just now, we essentially/equivalently initiate a flood fill on every 1
	- ie every node is now a potential starting node
- but point is that future initiations can be skipped, if they've alrdy been 'filled'
	- 'filling' can be handled via actually changing the value
		- this is an optimization specific to this 'kind of' problem imo
	- or by maintaining another structure for visited/filled nodes
		- see result below

## exploring connected components
- this problem, don't really have an obvious 'representative' for each component
	- compare with [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](128.%20Longest%20Consecutive%20Sequence.md)
- so the general fundy:
	- initially plan to iterate over all 'valid' starting nodes
		- aka here: not all nodes; it's just the 1s
	- but as you visit stuff: update 'valid' starting nodes
		- aka 'valid' will also mean: have not visited yet
		- and std/general way to track this is just hashmap; aka collissions
	- and so what this means is that: the traversal only gets initiated on a node if its a new connected component
		- bc alrdy visited connected components are fully explored by the traversal

## bfs traversal basics


## dfs traversal basics


### simplest template

```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex(v) 
	for each neighbor y of v
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			DFS(G, y) 
	state[v] = “processed” 
```

### full template

```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex_early(v) 
	time = time + 1 
	entry[v] = time 
	for each neighbor y of v
		process_edge(v, y)
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			DFS(G, y) 
	process_vertex_late(v) 
	state[v] = “processed” 
	exit[v] = time 
	time = time + 1

```


- the aux/stub functions
	- more details (skiena lectures)
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y2UsrWaSnA&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DXbHTFe_w9zFPXeau28CDao&index=11&t=1980

	- to do something ONCE for every vertex/edge
		- in particular, for an undirected graph: the first time we visit an edge
			- so in undirected case: need to add some conditionals for the edge stub; you probly dont want to run this every time
		- aka don't want to process each edge twice






### extension templates (wip)

#### processing vertex early vs later
```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex_early(v) 
	for each neighbor y of v
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			DFS(G, y) 
	process_vertex_late(v) 
	state[v] = “processed” 
```



#### entry/exit times
```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex(v) 
	time = time + 1 
	entry[v] = time 
	for each neighbor y of v
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			DFS(G, y) 
	state[v] = “processed” 
	exit[v] = time 
	time = time + 1

```


#### process edge
```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex(v) 
	for each neighbor y of v
		process_edge(v, y)
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			DFS(G, y)
	state[v] = “processed” 
```


- more about process edge: 
	- probly: it doesn't literally mean 'only operate on the edge'
	- means: do some processing, based on the fact that (v,y) is an edge
		- the process can also be dependent on whether y is discovered or not
	- ie think of the 'process' functions as: they do something based on the parameters
		- (so we do end up realizing that 'process' is the right word here, but imo it's not actually obvious until I clarify it)


- like even tho the edge is involved...it's not really 'dependent' on whether we've just found the edge or not..and i suspect, the intention of 'process edge' is supposed to be: it's based on whether this is the first time we've seen it
	- I suspect there is no such thing as process edge early and late...bc most algos, you only want to process it once
