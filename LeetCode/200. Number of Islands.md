[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**  
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**  
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**  
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## traversal basics
- [733. Flood Fill](733.%20Flood%20Fill.md)
- this is basically just flood fill
- it's just now, we essentially/equivalently initiate a flood fill on every 1
	- ie every node is now a potential starting node
- but point is that future initiations can be skipped, if they've alrdy been 'filled'
	- 'filling' can be handled via actually changing the value
		- this is an optimization specific to this 'kind of' problem imo
	- or by maintaining another structure for visited/filled nodes
		- see result below

## exploring connected components
- this problem, don't really have an obvious 'representative' for each component
	- compare with [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](128.%20Longest%20Consecutive%20Sequence.md)
- so the general fundy:
	- initially plan to iterate over all 'valid' starting nodes
		- aka here: not all nodes; it's just the 1s
	- but as you visit stuff: update 'valid' starting nodes
		- aka 'valid' will also mean: have not visited yet
		- and std/general way to track this is just hashmap; aka collissions
	- and so what this means is that: the traversal only gets initiated on a node if its a new connected component
		- bc alrdy visited connected components are fully explored by the traversal

## dfs
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0

        islands = 0
        visit = set()
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (
                r not in range(rows)
                or c not in range(cols)
                or grid[r][c] == "0"
                or (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return

            visit.add((r, c))
            directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
            for dr, dc in directions:
                dfs(r + dr, c + dc)

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visit:
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(r, c)
