[347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
```

# Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1], k = 1`  
**Output:** `[1]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

# Results

## using #trees/heaps for sorting

- max vs min heap
	- can we always use both for a problem?
		- (i think so)
			- one would be size of input
			- other will be size of solution
		- if so: what are differences in
			- implementation
			- complexity 
		- (expect: you should implement the variation that corresp to size of solution)
- python implementation
	- heap module
		- methods
			- heappushpop



## #sorting/bucket_sort 
- since `nums` has size `n`, we know the max possible frequency is `n`
	- aka we have a bound/finite set of values (aka the counts)
	- aka we know counts can only fall among n distinct values, where n is max size of array)
	- so we have this technique



# Approaches

## compute and sort counts
- implementations
	- max heap
	- min heap
	- quickselect
	- bucket sort



```
# max heap
time O(N log N)


# min heap
time O(N log K)



# quickselect
time O(N log K) i think



# bucket sort
time O(N)


```







 
### Max heap

### Min heap
- still O(n) space, bc of counts structure
	- ie even tho heap structure is O(k); we have k <= n

python: better: use heappushpop:

### Quick select

cpp quick select (i think)

### Bucket sort
```
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
        for n, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(n)

        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res
```


- strategy
	- create a list of lists `bucket` of length `n+1`, to store numbers by frequency
		- ie if `num` occurs `freq` times, then we append `num` to the list stored at `bucket[freq]`
		- `bucket[freq]` needs to be a list, bc multiple values can have the same frequency
	- then iterate backwards through `bucket` to grab the most frequent numbers, until we find the `k` most frequent
		- bc most frequent elements are at the end of the array
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- should be strictly better than the other approaches
	- O(n) space
		- O(n) to store counts
			- if every elt is unique, then the counts structure will be same size
		- the constant is probly worse compared to other approaches, bc of the buckets array
