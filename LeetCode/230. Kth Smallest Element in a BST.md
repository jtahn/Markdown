[230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description
Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227114511.png)  
**Input:** `root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227114520.png)  
**Input:** `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

# Approaches

```


class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        curr = root

        while stack or curr:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return curr.val
            curr = curr.right
