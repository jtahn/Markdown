[32. Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, return _the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "(()"`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = ")()())"`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = ""`  
**Output:** `0`  

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `s[i]` is `'('`, or `')'`.

This is because the code does not account for the position of each parentheses group, rather, how many `(` and `)` there are.  
Take this example, `( ( () ()`. Notice the end pair of brackets form a group of length 2.  
However because you are counting the number of parentheses, at the end you do not get equal number of `(` and `)`, hence it is never compared to max.

The basic idea is that `(` open potential for new brackets to form. Whereas `()) . . .` we instantly know that the 3rd bracket has 0 potential because it is `)`.

Hence, when we have a case like `((()()()` we must iterate backwards and do the same thing.

instead, `)` represent brackets for potential to match, and `(` have no potential

Consider it kind of like prefix and suffix array.




#/workflow 
- in the 'todo list of completeness of writeup':
	- 'checking lc forums' means:
		- going through top description comments
		- going through top lc solution writeups AND comments

#/jargon
- need a tag for:
	- (currently, #dynamic_programming/similar )
	- dp variant where you solve a 'similar' problem g, and then answer is efficient routine over output to similar problem
	- rename this tag to that polya jargon for where you 'solve a similar problem'


#stacks 
- other ppl seem to confirm what i was thinking...stacks are often used in like a few of the same patterns
	- simulation was one of them
		- monotone might be a special case of simulation
		- but it seems it's such a major pattern itself, that maybe it should be it's own subtag...and then just mention that its actually a special case
	- i forget the others, but i had this observation in some of the other stack problems i just did
	- aka...probly have subtags for each of these main patterns



#/problems 
(do these if i haven't yet, and then assign the stack subtags i mentioned above)

Next Greater Element  
Next Smaller Element  
Previous Greater Element  
Previous Smaller Element  
Largest Rectangle in Histogram



#/fundy
- for #dynamic_programming  variants where the dp array is '1 size larger than input'
- prepend with a char so that first entry of dp array is 0
- and so then it means dp array indices match up with string indices
- tho idk...this trick seems fairly limited? aka idk how well this generalizes...
	- aka i should regardless be comfy with 'not matching indices btwn input and dp table'

```python
    s2 = ')' + s
    # dp[i] := the length of the longest valid parentheses in the substring
    # s2[1..i]
    dp = [0] * len(s2)
```



# References


## #ad_hoc  1

- likely should have similar observations in
	- [[20. Valid Parentheses]]


- abstraction
	- 'parenthesis' is like abstract version of:
		- 2 types of elements: 'start' and 'end'


- key observations for both strats:
	- if we iterate left to right:
		- left parenthesis don't really let us 'determine' anything valid substring length at an index
		- right parenthesis are when we can actually compute stuff

- then the strats below are really just, different ways of how to 'compute' stuff when you see a right parenthesis


## 'not dp'

- btw, this is definitely NOT the 'correct' way to solve this problem
	- but imo, it'll be very important/valuable to find a clean way to explain why
	- there's 2 big takeaways that imo i need to explain:
		- (and imo both come from understanding the 'abstract' structure of the problem)
		- why this is not a dp problem
		- why the 'idea underlying stack approach' is better than 'idea underlying the dp approach'



- apparently not #dynamic_programming :
	- no overlapping subproblems?
	- 'storing stuff' != dp


- if this is not dp:
	- then whatever tag i put this under:
		- should explain why this is NOT dp
		- and probly tag dp as well, as an example of what dp is NOT
	- maybe
		- if solution is like 'max over dp table' or smthn like that...then it's not dp?
		- ie dp should always be: solution is 'final entry of table'



- also, i need an example/diagram here

---


- define `f[i]` = length of the longest valid substring ending at index `i - 1`
	- answer will be `max(f)`
- conditions:
	- if char at `i - 1` is '('
		- then no valid substring can end with this character
		- so `f[i] = 0`
	- if char at `i - 1` is ')'
		- if char at `i - 2`is '('
			- we have a pair "()"
			- so `f[i] = f[i - 2] + 2`
		- if char at `i - 2` is also ')'
			- then `f[i]` is either:
				- 0
				- `f[i - 1] + 2 + f[i - f[i - 1] - 2]`
			- see explanation below


- explaining the case `))`:
	- (for some reason) you know either:
		- (feels this is the crucial observation/idea underlying this strat)
		- no valid substring ending here
		- longest valid substring here is the concat of:
			- immediately enclosing the 'longest valid substring' that ended at the prev index
				- enclosing pair is what gives the `2`
				- prev index answer is what gives `f[i-1]`
			- and prepend the longest valid substring adjacent to the 'enclosed substring' above
			- NOTE: this is only possible if we have the enclosing portion
				- aka BOTH:
					- valid substring ending at previous index
						- ie `f[i-1] != 0`
					- open parenthesis immediately before that substring
- so now let's figure out how to actually compute the above...aka lots of indexing busy work
	- we want to compute `f[i]`
		- which corresp to`s[i-1]`
	- the solution/substring that ends (INCLUSIVE) at `s[i-2]` has length `f[i-1]`
		- so this substring starts at index `i-2 - f[i-1] + 1`
			- aka `i - 1 - f[i-1]`
		- ie if right endpt at index 4, and length 2, then left endpt is index 3
			- 4-2+1 = 3
			- can also think of it like 4 - (2-1) = 3
	- and so we then want to check for open parenthesis immediately prior
		- aka at string index `k = i - 2 - f[i-1]`
	- and we also want to know the solution ending at string index `k-1`
		- this is `f[k]`
- so recap:
	- confirm that both:
		- solution at `f[i-1]` is nonzero
		- open parenthesis at `s[i-2-f[i-1]]`
	- if so, then do some math that also involves:
		- solution at `f[i-2-f[i-1]]`




## #stacks 


- maybe
	- #simulation 
	- rn this also seems so #ad_hoc
	- 'monotone stack' variant
		- (doesn't seem like the right inspo)
		- like Next Greater element or Previous Smaller element
		- (??) we are trying to maintain the order inside the stack instead of a monotonically increasing or decreasing sequence

- imo the true key inspo here, should not be about stack
	- but it should immediately lead to a stack being the natural structure


- (idk how to word the true inspo correctly)
- structure
	- bottom of stack
		- index of
			- 'earliest valid starting point for current valid substring'
			- 'latest right parenthesis where we restarted current valid substring'
		- so it's initialized to `-1`
	- rest of stack
		- indices of unclosed left parentheses
		- indices let us compute 'valid substring length that ends here'


- imo the crucial observation/idea:
	- bottom of the stack: it's NOT an unclosed left parenthesis
	- thus, popping top is not exactly 'closing' a parenthesis
		- it's more like 'attempting' to close
	- and means: after popping:
		- we only have valid substring if stack is nonempty
		- so if stack is now empty: means something like:
			- we now have an extra closing bracket
			- so any further extensions of previous valid parentheses is not possible
			- so reset 'current valid substring'
			- push this pos as a 'new starting point'


- also another important and subtle idea is that:
	- the structure stores indices, so that we can compute length
	- ie we're not storing 'left' or 'right' parenthesis
		- this is handled by the stack OPERATION (ie push or pop)
		- not what is actually stored


# Strategies

## 'not dp'

- complexity
	- time O(n)
	- space O(n)
- implementation:
	- do not need a conditional for the case `char=="("`
		- bc dp table entry is already 0





```python
class Solution:
2    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
4        string_length = len(s)
5        # Initialize a DP array with zeros, one extra for the base case
6        dp = [0] * (string_length + 1)
7      
9        for i, char in enumerate(s, 1):
11            if char == ")":
13                if i > 1 and s[i - 2] == "(":
15                    dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + 2
16                else:
18                    j = i - dp[i - 1] - 1
20                    if j > 0 and s[j - 1] == "(":
23                        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2 + dp[j - 1]
26        return max(dp)
```



## stack


- complexity
	- time O(n)
	- space O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = [-1]
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    stack.append(i)
                else:
                    ans = max(ans, i - stack[-1])
        return ans
```
