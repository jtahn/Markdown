[494. Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

- For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1], target = 1`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

#/strats
- #/fundy seems the standard/first problem for the 'partition /ubset' pattern is:
	- - [DP 14. Subset Sum Equals to Target | Identify DP on Subsequences and Ways to Solve them - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWX9xDmIzRI&list=PLgUwDviBIf0qUlt5H_kiKYaNSqJ81PMMY&index=16)
		- [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

		- 5:00 the problem is equivalent to partitioning into 2 subsets
			- one has pos signs, other has negative
			- and this problem is just https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoilQD1kYSg&list=PLgUwDviBIf0qUlt5H_kiKYaNSqJ81PMMY&index=20
				- note this doesn't directly exist in leetcode
				- this vid probly explains how this is 'dp'

#/cleanup 
chatgpt spit this out: lots of errors, but you can see the general structure/idea

1. **Subproblem Definition:**
    
    - Define a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (2*sum+1)` where `n` is the length of `nums` and `sum` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
    - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum of `j - sum` using the first `i` elements of `nums`.
2. **Base Cases:**
    
    - Initialize `dp[0][sum] = 1`, since there is one way to achieve a sum of `sum` without using any elements.
    - Initialize all other `dp[0][j] = 0` for `j != sum`, since there are no ways to achieve any other sum without using any elements.
1. **Recurrence Relation:**
    
    - For `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from `-sum` to `sum`:
        - If `j - nums[i-1]` is within the bounds of `dp`, then `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]]`, since we can add `nums[i-1]` with a positive sign.
        - If `j + nums[i-1]` is within the bounds of `dp`, then `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j+nums[i-1]]`, since we can add `nums[i-1]` with a negative sign.
2. **Solution:**
    
    - The number of ways to achieve the target sum `target` is `dp[n][target+sum]`, since `dp[n][target+sum]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum of `target` using all elements of `nums`.

#/strats
- what is the 'name' of the neetcode strategy?
	- i like the name 'induction' atm
	- (it's not dp)
	- ie has same idea as 'brute force' from [[46. Permutations]]
		- ie at each level/step, generate what is possible)
	- #/jargon what type of strat are these? 'inductive' seems like the correct term
		- seems like a strat/idea that is still worth remembering/pointing out
		- and also the observation that: this technique doesn't just apply to problems where we 'generate all things'
			- bc we use this technique to 'find number of ways to achieve specific thing'
			- by using a dictionary; ie saving not just keys, but key+values
		- aka here, there's 2 ideas going on:
			- induction
			- use dict to store num ways
		- actually instead of 'induction'...maybe consider it 'bfs' on 'graph of states'


#/strats
- probly include backtracking solution here too
	- bc best space complexity
	- compare the approaches
		- time complexity of dp vs backtracking:
			- based on number of 'leaves' in their 'graph'
			- and you expect the 'graph' of states to have far less 'leaves' than tree of 'candidates'
		- space complexity
			- for dp: it's the second to last level (aka based on width)
				- bc need to store possible states on prev level
			- for backtracking: it's really only the height
				- bc only really need to know what the current partial candidate is
				- some extra storage for 'possible inputs/actions' corresp to the loops
					- bc want to know where in the 'loops' we are
					- but this should barely take up anything



#/research 
- figure out why everyone brings up knapsack or 'partition subset sum'
	- i don't think these are actually optimal approaches here


#/meta 
- the 'maybe' tag indicates:
	- i'm trying to figure out the key ideas here
	- my ideas might be wrong

#/meta 
- neetcode is not reliable
	- [[494. Target Sum]] is another example
- takeUforward is extremely reliable AND convenient
	- aka from now on, just use him
	- he can be longwinded, but that's fine; easy to scrub through youtube
		- or even better: figure out my 'youtube to transcription to summary' workflow

- #/jargon figure out the correct jargon here
	- #/todo imo either add a combinatorics textbook, or use combinatorics lecture notes
	- temporary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_combinations_with_repetition
- instead of (partial) 'candidates': look at (partial) states
	- #/jargon confirm the jargon for partial, candidates, states
	- here: instead of multisubsets of signs; look at what they sum to
- choice of storage
	- dictionary more efficient than array

- #/maybe 
	- at each step:
		- storage corresp to the possible states
		- NOT the possible candidates	
	- can think of it like: 'downward' bfs on 'directed graph' of partial/possible sums/states
		- the 'root' is like the 'base case states'
		- #/todo surely there's a term for this kind of 'graph'?
			- it's not a tree
			- basically each level is the possible sums/states at that level
			- and edges connecting states that are achievable from each other
		- versus backtracking is like: dfs on the tree of partial candidates
	- #/todo is this really dp? (confirm what def of dp is)
		- it just seems weird bc:
			- we don't seem to have 'subproblems'
			- we don't "solve" all 'subproblems/states'
			- states on the lower level tell + possible actions: these are what tell you what states are possible on the next level
		- one way you could think of this as subproblems...it's jsut a lot of them are trivially solved bc the answer is 0
			- which makes me think: you shouldn't think of these as subproblems. it's not the natural way
			- aka i need to figure out what ppl actually call this
		- or maybe this is an example of dp where:
			- you 'push' lower level solutions TO higher levels
			- vs you 'pull' lower level solns FROM higher levels

- #/maybe
	- the correct abstraction here is 'candidates' vs 'states'
		- candidates incorporates all of the ideas of permutations, combinations, subsets, multisubsets
			- aka all the diff ways to combine inputs
			- aka combinatorics
		- states refers to the 'output' of each candidate
		- and something about this problem (and seems, many DP problems) is that:
			- we care about the states, not the candidates
			- the state 'does not care' about 'candidate choices/actions' that happened 'in the past'
- so This strategy is applicable to problems where
	- the focus is on the values generated by combining inputs and actions, rather than the specific combinations themselves
		- classic examples seem to be:
			- number of ways to do achieve a 'value'
			- determine if a 'value' can be achieved
	- you expect the space of possible states to be much smaller than space of possible candidates
		- thus: improved time complexity
		- but possibly much worse space complexity, depending on how many states you need to store
			- i don't think there's a way to 'backtrack' over states
				- partly bc there are generally going to be multiple different 'previous states' that could have led here
- at each step
	- you iterate through the diff ways you could use inputs and actions at that step
	- see how this modifies previous states to produce new states



- note:
	- this approach has strong connection to underlying 'candidates' structure
		- which is a huge tree
			- up to size $m^n$ where $m$ is number actions per level, and $n$ is number of levels
	- the point is that there is something about this problem, where we can basically ignore 'partial candidate' choices/actions that occurred on previous levels
		- which is why it's enough to store states
	- storing states will typically result in much better time complexity
		- bc many partial candidates result in same partial state
		- but far worse space complexity
			- bc need to store all possible states
			- versus: could just do backtracking on candidate tree, which is likely very space efficient...bc it's often pretty easy to just have a structure for the 'current partial candidate' and efficient to determine how to make/unmake moves

- storage structure
	- you use dictionary bc two things
		- need to efficiently update values
			- different states on previous level can have contributions to same state on the next level; need to be able to combine contributions
			- linked list is bad for this
		- need to efficiently find values
			- want to iterate over sums that were actually achieved on previous level
			- array is bad for this
	- dictionary
		- size bounded by possible unique sums (which is bounded by num subsets)
			- aka 2^n
		- but 'in general' you wouldn't expect it to be this bad
			- #/jargon there's def a word to use here instead of 'in general'...i don't think it's 'on avg'..i'm trying to be like, 'most inputs' will be a lot better

#/maybe
- a strat that probs works: backtracking with no pruning
	- but probly no real time complexity benefits...bc still visit everything in search space
	- wait so why not just do brute force...seems backtracking has no benefit
		- bc brute force wouldnt use much space either (ie checking every possible sequences of signs)
- seems actual important idea/observation:
	- naive description of search space: `2^n` possible strings
	- dp description of search space: `len(nums) * (sum(nums)*2)` subproblems
		- if nums allowed negative numbers...then it'd be like 'sum of abs values'



```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        dp = {}  # (index, total) -> # of ways

        def backtrack(i, total):
            if i == len(nums):
                return 1 if total == target else 0
            if (i, total) in dp:
                return dp[(i, total)]

            dp[(i, total)] = backtrack(i + 1, total + nums[i]) + backtrack(
                i + 1, total - nums[i]
            )
            return dp[(i, total)]

        return backtrack(0, 0)
