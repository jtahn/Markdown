https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



**Example 1:**
**Input:**` strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
**Output:** `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `strs = [""]`
**Output:** `[[""]]`

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `strs = ["a"]`
**Output:** `[["a"]]`



**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Brute force
- strategy
	- iterate through the words:
		- start of loop: previously iterated words are alrdy grouped up into anagrams
		- for next word: check if its an anagram with an arbitrary member of each group
			- (this comparison check can be done by: comparing sorted words; or comparing letter counts)
		- if no matches, then it creates its own group
- complexity
	- this probably has same complexity as the more efficient approaches..but it has noticeably higher constant.
	- basically the better methods use observation: we can avoid having to constantly repeating the 'comparison' step via hashing

# Hashing
- strategy
	- use dictionary: each word generates a key
	- 2 choices for key (anagrams should result in the same key):
		- sorted word
			- complexity depends on sorting algo
		- array/dict of counts
			- O(n) time (better)



## key is char counts
```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```
