[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**` strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`  
**Output:** `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `strs = [""]`  
**Output:** `[[""]]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `strs = ["a"]`  
**Output:** `[["a"]]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Observation
- comparison check to identify anagrams: we need to generate something so that they result in the same thing iff angram
	- this is actually alrdy a leetcode problem, and we alrdy know the main solutions are
		- sorted word
			- complexity depends on sorting algo
		- array/dict of counts (better)
			- O(m) time  (for word length m)

# Brute force
- strategy
	- use a list of lists to store anagrams
		- each inner list stores all the words that are anagrams of each other
	- iterate through the words: for each word:
		- check if its an anagram with an arbitrary member of each group
		- if no matches, then create its own group
- complexity (n is num word, m is length of longest string)
	- O(n^2 m)
		- O(n) from iterating over the words
		- then for each word: 
			- O(m) to compute that word's letter counts
			- another O(m) for each representative we have to check
				- worst case, no words are anagrams: so then checking all representatives is O(mn)
			- so O(m+mn) total
	- space
		- O(nm) bc we want result to store the actual words
# Hashing
```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```

- observation:
	- whatever check we do, the result can be hashed and used as a key; which means checking representatives now only takes O(1) time, instead of O(m)
	- ACTUALLY: we're not even checking representatives; we just append it to a group
	- so there's 2 speedups here: not only do we not have to recompute letter counts for representatives; but actually, there's no comparison step either. bc we just store the word at the key
- strategy
	- use dictionary to store groups of anagrams
- complexity
	- time
		- O(mn)  
			- O(n) to loop over each word
			- for each word
				- O(m) to compute its key (via letter counts)
					- generally O(m log m) if you use sorted word as the key
				- O(1) to store word at the key
	- space
		- O(nm) bc solution array requires the actual words
