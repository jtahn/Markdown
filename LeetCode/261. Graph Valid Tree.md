class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    
```

# Description

You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer n and a list of `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the graph.

Return `true` _if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417155150.png)  
**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]`  
**Output:** `true`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
- `a_i != b_i`
- There are no self-loops or repeated edges.

# Approaches




## union-find


If a graph is a valid tree, it must have exactly n - 1 edges. Besides, it cannot be fully connected and contain any cycles. Therefore, we just need check if there are n - 1 edges and any cycles. We can use DSU to check if element A and element B share the same parent. If so, it means that they are united, a cycle wound be there. Hence, we can return false immediately as a valid tree cannot have a cycle. Otherwise, we unite both element. If there is no cycle after iterating all elements, then we can simply check if there are n - 1 edges. There are other ways such as DFS and BFS to solve it.

To determine if the set of edges forms a valid tree, the "[Union Find](https://algo.monster/problems/dsu_intro)" algorithm is an excellent choice. This algorithm is a classic approach used in [graph](https://algo.monster/problems/graph_intro) theory to detect cycles and check for connectivity within a graph.

Here's why [Union Find](https://algo.monster/problems/dsu_intro) works for checking tree validity:

1. **Union Operation**: This is used to connect two nodes. If they are already connected, it means we're trying to add an extra connection to a connected pair, indicating the presence of a cycle.
2. **Find Operation**: This operation helps in finding the root of each node, generally used to check if two nodes have the same root. If they do, a cycle is present since they are already connected through a common ancestor. If not, we can perform an union operation without creating a cycle.
3. **Path Compression**: This optimization helps in flattening the structure of the tree, which improves the time complexity of subsequent "Find" operations.

In our solution, we start with each node being its own parent (representing a unique set). Then, we iterate through each edge, applying the "Find" operation to see if any two connected nodes share the same root:

- If they do, we've detected a cycle and return `false` as a cycle indicates it's not a valid tree.
- If they don't, we connect (union) them by updating the root of one node to be the root of the other.

As we connect nodes, we also decrement 'n' as an additional check. If at the end of processing all edges, there's more than one disconnected component, 'n' will be greater than 1, indicating the [graph](https://algo.monster/problems/graph_intro) is not fully connected, thus not a valid tree. If 'n' is exactly 1, it means the graph is fully connected without cycles, so it's a valid tree and we return `true`.

## dfs


- [Graph Valid Tree - Leetcode 261 - Python - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXsUuownnoQ&list=PLPe9IkX86X3y5m_MvtNu2ughxsvkqUNKr&index=91)


- build adjacency lists
- dfs on any of the nodes and check that there is no loop/cycle
	- ie dont visit something we've already visited (other than parent; bc parent will always be in adjacency list of the child call)


```python
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        if not n:
            return True
        adj = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
        for n1, n2 in edges:
            adj[n1].append(n2)
            adj[n2].append(n1)

        visit = set()

        def dfs(i, prev):
            if i in visit:
                return False

            visit.add(i)
            for j in adj[i]:
                if j == prev:
                    continue
                if not dfs(j, i):
                    return False
            return True

        return dfs(0, -1) and n == len(visit)
