[24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151352.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `[2,1,4,3]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `head = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `head = [1]`  
**Output:** `[1]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

# todo

#/style 
- no need to include recursive strats for the sake of 'practicing' recursion
	- i plan to have enough problems with recursive solutions that have inherent value, so i'll already get enough practice via those
- in particular: do not include recursive strat if it is obvious that there EXISTS a more efficient iterative strat
	- i'm being intentional with the wording here: i'm saying the 'existence' of the strat is obvious
		- not necessarily the actual details/steps/implementation
- ie [[24. Swap Nodes in Pairs]]
	- obvious that recursive strat would use O(n) space
	- obvious that an iterative strat exists, and would only need O(1) space
		- bc the desired operations are local
			- ie at most 6 nodes involved at a time



#/style
- remember, the goal is to 'memorize' both strats AND implementations
	- it is 'easier' to memorize implementations that align most with the 'strat'
	- bc then, 'memorizing implementation' will mostly be about 'memorizing' the strat
	- so when an implementation deviates in a noticeable way:
		- it should only be because there are very obvious benefits
			- if complexity (both constant and asymptotic): then probly, it should be considered a 'distinct' strat
			- are there ever situtations where the benefit is 'far cleaner code'?
				- bc tbh, i'm thinking, if this happens: then it's probably indicating that there's actually a different underlying strat/inspo
- #/workflow so when revising implementations: always think about:
	- does implementation match up 'exactly' with the strat/inspo
	- and if not: is it bc:
		- i should rewrite code?
		- different strat?
- ie [[24. Swap Nodes in Pairs]]
	- lots of 'guides' do 3 pointer updates per iteration
		- aka 1 more than what is actually 'necessary'
		- does not rly align with the 'inspo'; this is just an implementation decision that they prefer, tho tbh i have no clue why, bc no complexity benefits

#/style
- how detailed is a strat?
	- as above, we're saying that it needs to immediately lead to an implementation
	- a 'step' of the strat does not mean 'one line of code' in implementation
		- ie 'dfs' can be a step of 'strat', even tho it has multiple lines of code
	- in particular:
		- if implementation requires cases, then the strat needs to mention this as well



#/style
- another consider of whether to keep (or how to rank) strats, is on how 'cleanly' we can implement them
- ie [[24. Swap Nodes in Pairs]]
	- the base idea is to update 2 pointers for each pair of nodes
	- an initial strat is:
		- for each pair, do both of these updates in same iteration
		- but this does not lead to clean implementation, bc now you need a separate case to handle the 'last pair' of nodes
	- so this should be distinguished from the 'better' strat:
		- for each pair:
			- do intra-update in 'current' iteration
			- do inter-update in 'next' iteration
		- aka for each iteration:
			- do intra-update for 'current' pair
			- do inter-update with 'previous' pair

- ! possible progression of ideas:
	- !!! first group pairs of nodes
		- do this bc: ignoring pointers for a sec:
		- these are how these nodes 'switch positions'
		- ie group based on positions, not pointers
		- basically, why it's very natural to pair nodes up like (1,2), (3,4), etc
		- it's just based on the order; nothing to do with pointers
	- now, we think about what this means for pointers
	- then you think about what this means for implementation/iteration
		- aka what nodes are involved
	- then you realize: separate your initial pairs across diff iterations
		- ie the pointer updates for a pair: you will do them in diff iterations 
	- bc of the 'duality' btwn 'curr pairs/pointers' and 'curr iterations':
		- 'do this curr pointer update in next iteration' means 'in curr iteration, do prev pointer update'
	- and then 'linked list trick':
		- diff iterations via: adjust  pointers from curr and prev pair
		- dummy node

- the above progression is very clean actually, so imo this problem isn't actually about differences btwn those ideas
	- aka another example of a linked list problem just being about, how well you can progress through ideas and think about 'clean implementation'
	- 



- !!!!!! i think this is the inspo for one of the fundies:
	- the way you 'cleanly' handle 'inner' vs 'last' case:
		- is by having the current iteration handle stuff from 'previous cases', so that the 'last case' becomes 'do nothing'
		- however, you can add as many dummy nodes as you like, to the beginning!!!!
			- and very easy to figure out what the actual start was..just remember what the last 'dummy' is
		- wait i do think this is very key
	- actually it's even more subtle than this:
		- here, the last case isn't just 'last pair/single node'
		- it's also, the 'penultimate pair, in the case where last pair is a single node'
			- bc then for: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,None]`
			- the point is that:
				- it's not just that you do nothing for (7,None)
				- it's also that (5,6) needs to be handled specially, from (3,4)
					- because for (5,6): the pair after it, is not getting switched
	- so i think a key idea here is that you basically really want to avoid having a bunch of special 'last cases'
		- this can happen if your strat asks you to look forward
		- so i think for linked list, the idea is that you want to minimize the number of 'operations requiring you to look forward'
		- aka always prefer to 'look backward'





- ok so actually, i don't think this problem is about:
	- differences btwn all of: current:
		- 'current nodes to update pointers'
		- 'current nodes involved'
		- 'current iteration'

- bc tbh, the first 2 things...those are involved with each other
- and also it's not really 'differences' btwn 'iteration' and 'nodes/pointers'
	- i think the idea there is really just about, figuring out a clean strat

- observe that there are 2 types of pointer swaps that need to happen
	- 'intra' and 'inter' pair
	- in example: 1:
		- 'intra': want 2->1 instead of 1->2
		- 'inter': want 1->4 instead of 2->3

now the key here becomes, how to handle this 'inter'-pair update


- i think the correct order of observations:
	- tbd
	- realize that some of the operations on 'current nodes' ...
	- the point is that i think, the 'use dummy nodes' observations comes LAST:
		- realize that this routine only works for inner nodes
		- then use a dummy node so that front doesn't need to be a special case


- !! there's a distinction btwn:
	- 'nodes that are involved'
	- 'nodes that you want to edit pointers for'
- and one of the observations i'm trying to state is that you should focus on the second, bc these are the actual 'operations' you need to do
	- the first one is probly what helps you decide what 'history' nodes you need to store

- and another observation: for implementation:
	- the 'current nodes to want to edit pointers for', maybe should not all happen in 'current iteration'
	- bc if u want to do that here, then to 'edit pointers for 1,2' in same iteration:
		- then u need to 'involve' nodes 3 and 4 as well
		- ie an iteration needs to fetch nodes that are 2 steps ahead
		- and this is a problem bc now: the 'last group' becomes a special case:
			- it is an error to try to look 2 nodes ahead, bc node 3=None, and can't have anything after this...like 3.next isn't a thing 


for linked lists: bc of dummy nodes, this means that when you split up 'pointer updates for current nodes' across iterations: this means that how you actually implement this is:
that how 
or better way to say this:
if need to make 'updates across pairs':
do this via a 'current iteration' operating on 'previous' pairs, bc dummy nodes that front of list won't have to be a separate case 



- 1 point i'm trying to say here:
- for linked list problems, once you add dummy nodes to head and have the right 'break' conditions:
	- it seems then there really are no 'special cases' btwn front and inner
		- ie how you handle the first 'group' of nodes, is identical to inner 'groups' of nodes
	- and the last 'group': if the 'special case' is 'do nothing', then this will be handled with proper break condition



- inspo:
	- this is bc the structure of the linked list:
	- basically, bc of how 'edges'/relationships are always directed 'forwards':
		- (once you add dummy nodes) then there's really no distinction btwn how you handle inner versus forward

	- ie in example 1: when thinking about how you handle the changes involving nodes 3 and 4:
		- it's true that 'pair 1,2' is involved, bc need to change how they point to (3,4)
		- even though these are 'inside' the structure:
			- you exclusively worry about how  should initially not really worry 

- it's true your routine: for 'current pair', also adjusts pointers from 'previous' pair, 
	- point 1: no special case btwn front and inner: bc once you add dummy, then this auto gets handled
	- the inspo to realize that the routine should do this:
		- it's not from looking at current pair, and wondering how to adjust pointers for previous pair
		- it's from looking at current pair, and realizing that some of the operations will be easier to do in the next iteration
	- aka i feel linked list problems:
		- you never 'looking backwards to see what operations you do'
		- you always 'look forwards' bc that's the direction of edges

    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        prev, first = dummy, head

        while first and first.next:
16            second, third = first.next, first.next.next
22            prev.next, second.next = second, curr
24            prev, first = first, third

	return dummy.next
