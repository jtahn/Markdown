```
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:

Evaluate the expression. Return _an integer that represents the value of the expression_.

**Note** that:
- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`  
**Output:** `9`  
**Explanation:** `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** `(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`  
**Output:** `22`  
**Explanation:**  
```
((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

# todo
- explain why "stack operation is correct wrt to polish notation"
	- it feels "obvious"..so figure out how to explain it properly
	- maybe one of the key points: the constraints say that you'll always be given a valid string
	- similarly, why "recursion is correct"
- btw:
	- stack = iterate forwards
	- recursion = iterate backwards
	- so maybe these really are 2 diff approaches..corresp to two diff interpretations of a how a valid polish notation string can be computed



# Stack

            else:
	            stack.append(int(t))

        return stack[-1]


"""purely using stack pops"""

- observation
	- The key here is to iterate through the tokens once and perform operations in order, ensuring the stack's top two elements are the operands for any operator we come across.
	- when we iterate through tokens we are going to reach at least 2 numbers before we reach an operator
	- by placing numbers in a stack, we will have access to the last 2 numbers that entered the stack, so that we can pop them off to perform the operation whenever we reach the operator.
	- The main problem to solve is now that we know we need to use a stack, but in which order do we handle our operations? For addition and multiplication, the order won't matter, but for subtraction and division, there is a difference depending on which number subtracts from which, or which is the dividend. By analyzing the examples we can see that the first number that gets popped off the stack appears to be our y value, and the second appears to be our x value in any expression `x/y` or `x-y`
		- Example: if our stack looks like: `[4,2]`, and our token is `/`. The expression should be analyzed as y=2, x=4 as we pop off the y first then the x, which will give us an answer of `4/2=2`
- strategy
	- for each string/token in `tokens`
		- if token is a number
			- cast to int; push
		- if token is an operator
			- pop the last two numbers and apply this operator
				- bc according to RPN: every time we encounter an operator, it applies to the last two operands that were seen
				- so these two numbers are the operands for the operator.
			- push result back onto stack
				- so stack is now in a state that is ready to process the next token
	- When we've processed all the tokens, the stack will contain only one element, which is the final result of the expression.
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- This is because the function iterates through each token exactly once. Each operation within the loop, including arithmetic operations and stack operations (append and pop), can be considered to have constant time complexity, O(1).
	- O(n) space
		- The space complexity of the code is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of tokens in the list. This worst-case scenario occurs when all tokens are numbers and are thus pushed onto the stack. In the best-case scenario, where the input is balanced with numbers and operators, the space complexity could be better than O(n)
- python notes
	- division by default results in a floating-point number
		- so even if both a and b are ints: a/b will be a float
- errors
	- the problem states that the division result should truncate toward zero
		- thus we need to use `int(a/b)`, not `a // b`
			- `int` discards the decimal part
				- could also use `math.trunc()`
			- `//` is rounding down
			- So if it the result was `-2/3`, we would get `-1` instead of `0`, which is what we want
- useful tricks:
	- to handle subtraction: (ie so i dont have to create variables for them on prev lines; similar to how add/mult are oneliners)
		- `stack.append(-stack.pop() + stack.pop())`
		- note: cannot do same trick with division; ie `num2 / num1` is not the same as `(1/num1) * num2`, because `1/num1` is 0 for any integer `num1 > 1`
			- ie if num1 = 2, num2 = 4:
				- `num2 / num1 = 2`
				- `(1/num1) * num2 = 0`
	- hash map of lambda/builtin functions
		- We can also significantly improve readability by utilizing a hash map, and lambda functions to map our operators to the operations they perform, instead of nesting a bunch of if/else clauses. But we could also utilize if/else, or switch cases, then for each case, `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, perform the required operation/function utilizing the top 2 numbers from the stack as the parameters.
- alternative: recursion
	- aka implicit stack
	- in aux function:
		- if operator
			- return the result of applying op on recursive calls to previous two indices
		- if number
			- return the number
	- same complexity. ie
		- O(n) time
		- O(n) space
			- bc of the call stack
- alternative: use end of the input list as a stack
	- ie append the stack onto the input list
	-  i.e. in above code, everywhere you see `stack`; you instead just put `tokens`
	- (this doesn't improve complexity)


# Stack (in-place)
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240307152711.png)
- idea
	- overwrite beginning of input with the stack
- strategy
	- emulate a 'stack' within the input list
	- we'll do this via a pointer `top` that points to top of the 'stack'
		- ie where a new entry will go
		- you'll never actually call push/pop
		- you'll emulate this behavior by overwriting the entry referenced by `top`, and then incrementing/decrementing `top`
	- iterate through array, and do the exact same conditionals/ops as the previous solutions
		- if you receive an integer, write it at `tokens[top]`, then increment `top`
		- if you receive an operator
			- use it on `tokens[top-1]` and `tokens[top-2]`
				- aka pop those elements off
			- put the new value on top of stack, aka `tokens[top-2]`
			- so a new element should go to `tokens[top-1]`
				- so set `top = top-1`
		- (note: can increment/decrement at different types during this routine, see code)
		- (imo this means my high level explanation shouldnt address when we change top; just say that make sure, i keep track of it somehow)
- note
	- we will never lose info; bc this 'stack' is at most the size of the stuff we've iterated over; and will be smaller once an operation occurs
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space
