[150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

```
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        
```

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return _an integer that represents the value of the expression_.

**Note** that:
- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`  
**Output:** `9`  
**Explanation:** `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** `(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`  
**Output:** `22`  
**Explanation:**  
```
((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

# todo
- discuss python's arithmetic builtins at the beginning
	- add, sub, mult, truediv
- cite/discuss python builtin "rounding" operators
	- int vs floor vs round vs any others
	- like all except int, will return a float
	- then cite/discuss rounding behavior of `//`
		- apparently inappropriate for this problem
		- bc the problem states that the division result should truncate toward zero
			- thus we need to use `int(a/b)`, not `a // b`
				- `int` discards the decimal part
					- could also use `math.trunc()`
				- `//` is rounding down
				- So if it the result was `-2/3`, we would get `-1` instead of `0`, which is what we want
- does `a/b` always result in a float?
- maybe this problem should be the fp for some/all of the things above?


# fundamental techniques
- replace multiple/similar conditional subroutines with a dictionary + general routine
	- here: dict of lambda/builtin functions

# global observations
- careful
	- need to cast 'numbers' to int, bc the elements are strings
	- careful about order of operands when doing sub and div
		- example:
			- if input is `[x, y, -]` or `[x, y, /]`
				- then we want to do `x-y` or `x/y`
			- note: when we encounter token `-`, the top (end) of stack looks like `[x, y]`
			- so if using a stack: first pop is `y`, second pop is `x

# backwards pass
```
"""recursion"""

				return int(t)

		n = len(tokens) - 1
		return aux(tokens, n)
```


- todo
	- is recursion the only implementation of this?
		- surely can do this via a stack as well?

- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space
		- bc of the call stack

 - todo
	- for div for 'multiple subroutines' solution:
		- could i do `(1/float(stack.pop)) * stack.pop`
			- without float: wouldnt work bc these are ints, so in general 1/stack.pop = 0
- strategy
	- forwards pass
	- immediately perform operations as we encounter them
		- this is possible (ie operands should be immediately available) bc valid notation
			- and bc we are assuming we have computed all preceding operations (so to be precise, could have an inductive arg here)
	- only store operands
		- (aka encountered and computed numbers)
		- use a stack to keep track of their correct order
			- ie stack's top two elements
			- (so pop both, perform op, then push result)
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- loop through tokens once
		- arithmetic and stack ops are O(1)
	- O(n) space
		- valid polish means approx half the entries are numbers
		- if all the numbers are provided first, then that means they're all pushed onto the stack
			- aka about size n/2



## in-place

            if t in ops:
                b, a = tokens[top], tokens[top-1]
                top -= 2
                t = ops[t](a,b)
                top += 1
                tokens[top] = t
            else:
	            top += 1
	            tokens[top] = int(t)
	
		return tokens[top]				# tokens[0]

```

- optimization idea
	- emulate a stack using space at the beginning of input
		- this is fine bc: 'stack' is at most the size of the stuff we've already encountered
	- maintain a pointer `top` that tracks the top of the 'stack'
		- emulate push/pop by
			- overwriting/referencing entries near `top`
			- incrementing/decrementing `top`
	- specific implementation can vary; ie:
		- `top` can reference the top element, or element immediately after
		- subroutines can combine pointer adjustments
- complexity
	- time: O(n)
	- space: in-place
