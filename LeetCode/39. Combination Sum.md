[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
```

# Description

Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in the array.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7`  
**Output:** `[[2,2,3],[7]]`  
**Explanation:**  
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.  
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.  
These are the only two combinations.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8`  
**Output:** `[[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `candidates = [2], target = 1`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
- All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
- `1 <= target <= 40`

## backtracking basics
- [78. Subsets](78.%20Subsets.md)

- standard backtracking approach seems to be:
	- subroutine to check the partial solution
		- aka determines whether we:
			- have a solution
			- have a valid partial solution
				- so, continue building paths; see next subroutine
			- have an invalid partial solution is already invalid
				- (occurs during more interesting problems)
					- if this is never a possibility, then it means our backtracking is essentially just checking every possible path
				- ie cannot be extended to a solution
				- so we prune/exit
	- subroutine that calls on future paths
		- ie recursively explore these
		- in 78, this is simple: only 1 neighbor to build path with
			- aka next entry in array


# Results

## backtracking on self
- 'with replacement' bc the problem states we can choose the same number "an unlimited number of times"
	- ie contrast with [78. Subsets](78.%20Subsets.md)
	- ie the key difference in this problem, is that future paths can 'repeatedly include/loop on the same element'

- this means we need an adjustment to the future paths on which we make calls
	- one future path is still just the next entry in array
	- but we also have a path that includes same element again
		- aka make a recursive call on self

- note 78's backtracking flow is:
	- add self
	- call on valid neighbors
	- remove self
	- call on valid neighbors
- versus here, we do:
	- add self
	- call on self
	- remove self
	- call on valid neighbors


- the point is that this 'minor' change in the second step, is what exactly handles the 'future paths can include self'
	- essentially, we see the call stack will:
		- add self as many times as possible to the partial soln
		- and then we will start removing self and trying neighbors
		- (and keep removing selves as neighbor calls finish traversing)



- (note: alternative implementation works: can move the neighbor call higher)
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/39
	- aka:
		- call on valid neighbors
		- add self
		- call on self
		- remove self
	- (which almost certainly means that 78 could do)
		- call on valid neighbors
		- add self
		- call on valid neighbors
		- remove self
	- (but this order is less intuitive imo)



# Approaches


## backtracking



- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/39
	- they sort before they run backtracking
	- but i don't think sorting actually does anything
		- generating solutions via backtracking: you won't have duplicates bc the provided array is all unique entries
		- i'm also pretty sure that it does nothing wrt pruning subtrees 'faster on average'

	- approach 1



```python
# no sort
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        def dfs(i, cur, total):
            if total == target:
                res.append(cur.copy())
                return
            if i >= len(candidates) or total > target:
                return

            cur.append(candidates[i])
            dfs(i, cur, total + candidates[i])
            cur.pop()
            dfs(i + 1, cur, total)

        dfs(0, [], 0)
        return res
```
