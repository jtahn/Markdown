[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return _the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227103747.png)  
**Input:** `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`  
**Output:** `10`  
**Explanation:** The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.  
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227103823.png)  
**Input:** `heights = [2,4]`  
**Output:** `4`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

- #problem_solving/solution_is_extreme_value 
	- a very common and general technique: interpret solution as an extreme of keys over a search space
		- so the main questions become:
			- determining what key to compute, so that an extreme value is a solution
			- is there a way to iterate through search space efficiently
			- is there a way to compute keys efficiently



- #stacks/monotone_stack 



# Results

#iteration/for_subroutine 

- ie optimize by computing keys more efficiently
	- keys = 'value you assign to elements'


- tbh this isn't really what this problem is...it's true it's about iterating a different way...but the reason doesn't exactly match other problems that use this tag
	- like typically that other tag is more about: strictly better efficiency
	- here: we get better time but trade off space
	- and also, the subroutine is like completely different...
	- idk, maybe it is the same thing tbh...like it's the same general thought process







# Strategies

## height from width
- implementations
	- brute force

```
	- for every pair of boundaries: (count n^2)
		- (ie for each width)
		- find the max rectangle using these boundaries
			- note: exactly corresp to the min height within these bounds
	- then return max over these computations/candidates

```



## width from height
- implementations
	- via stack: pre-compute both directions
	- via stack: pre-compute 1 direction; then intra-compute other direction

- idea: flip the previous approach
	- iterate over all possible 'min heights':
		- aka iterate over all heights in the array
	- for each height
		- find the max rectangle that uses this as the height 
		- aka find the max width
		- so problem boils down to: 'find first time a lower value occurs'
			- ie find first time in each direction, where height is lower
			- aka a height strictly lower than the current height you care about
			- cite [739. Daily Temperatures](739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md)
				- optimal: stack or DP
			- we do 2 passes bc we need to do this in both directions

- implementation:
	- for each index:
	- find index of first strictly lower element on each side
		- can treat each direction as an instance of [739. Daily Temperatures](739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md)		
		- (remember, from daily temps: better way is reverse iteration)
			- so when we want: first strictly lower element to the right
				- we iterate backwards/left
				- at each moment, stack holds all/the only elements that could possibly be the first strictly lower element
	- Assume their indexes are `prevSmaller[i]` and `nextSmaller[i]` 
	- then area of max rectangle we can form using `A[i]` is: 
		- `(nextSmaller[i] - prevSmaller[i] - 1) * A[i]`


- implementation variant:
	- precompute `nextSmaller` array
	- compute `prevSmaller` values on the fly
	- (same asymptotic space, but better constant)
		- bc instead of 2 arrays and a stack; just 1 array and a stack


---

- possible variant?
	- stack is non-decreasing instead of strictly-increasing
		- ie equality allowed

## 'currently valid rectangles'



- implementations
	- stack

```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        stack = []  # pair: (index, height)

        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > h:
                index, height = stack.pop()
                maxArea = max(maxArea, height * (i - index))
                start = index
            stack.append((start, h))
	
        for i, h in stack:			
            maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (len(heights) - i))
        return maxArea

```

- this approach needs tons of work!
	- correctness is fine
	- inspo/intuition is unclear/difficult


### todo

#/tbd 

- imo this should be a fundy for stacks as well; or at least, the following is def part of the inspo/intuition:
	- the way stacks are used here: it's as if the 'pop' operation is letting you backtrack to previously seen info
	- so if your problem only has 2 directions...consider if using a stack can make sense
	- (what do i call it?)


- figure out true intuition/inspo
	- note: imo this is NOT a refinement/optimization of the 2 pass approach; bc the structures are fundamentally holding different objects
		- ie this is an entirely new perspective on the problem

---

- attempt 1
	- step 1: what are we storing; and standard way to brute/compute this
	- step 2: identify properties that can make this efficient
		- and/or will make it clear why monotone stack is perfect
	- step 3: identify appropriate structure

- step 1:
	- 'all currently valid rectangles'
	
- step 2
	- the left boundary of a 'partial valid rectangle' extends at least through the rectangle before/below it
	- when a rectangle stops being valid; it also helps determine how much we can extend the new 'valid' item
		- You can automatically know where the index of the current rectangle should start based on what you're popping.
		- ie when you pop from the stack
			- realize: there's extra info you can glean from this
			- i.e. you can adjust the start index of the new rectangle you want to push
			- i.e. you also use the starting index of the thing you pop as the starting index of the thing you're about to add.


- step 3
	- so something about stacks (specifically, monotone stacks), is fundamentally/structural perfect for this kind of relationship
	- when you compare, and decide to pop: this actually lets you update/compute 2 bounds at the same time
		- one side of the thing you just popped
		- the other side of the thing you just compared it to

- at/after index j, the stack contains indices `i` (or objects corresp to index `i`) where:
	- the rectangle that contains `h[i]` and can be extended through `h[j]`
		- note: this auto implies that the stack has to be non-decreasing
		- how do i define it so that the stack is strictly increasing
			- aka: above means that if i have same adjacent heights, they would stay in the stack
			- i don't want that
	- "the unique rectangle containing `h[i]` that can be extended through `h[j]`
		- this doesn't rly make sense tbh...
	- exists a rectangle where first instance from the right of its lowest height is `h[i]`, and can be extended through `h[j]`
		- yes!
			- well the wording needs to be significantly cleaned up....how do i do better...
			- "the rectangle that contains `h[i]` can be extended through `h[j]`, and `h[i]` is it's height, and `h[i]` is the most rightward place where this height occurs (as of index `j`)"
		- this implies strictly increasing (it's pretty obvious; not totally obvious; but i don't think i can do better)
		- and does it imply that, the left bound of a stack item, has to corresp to index of item right below it?
			- yes, but its not obvious at all...i think i need a better definition??
			- pf: if index was earlier: then this would imply there should be a stack item here; bc this 'missing' height is involved with a rectangle could be extended to `h[j]` as well (because its shorter than `h[i]`, which was able to be extended) and is different from the stack item there rn, bc its shorter...
			- i think easier way to prove is probably: 
				- show that ALL the 'missing indices' `k` btwn these two stack items `top` and `below`...satisfy `h[below] < h[k] <= h[top]`. which means that `h[top]` can be extended all the way through `h[below+1]`
					- this should be easy to prove...but imo not worth typing up rn..i think this is way too involved....there should be something cleaner?

- suppose we are at index `i`
	- stack: contains all the rectangles that started at an index `j <= i`, and can survive `i`
		- i.e., `height[j] <= height[i]`
		- by construction, the rectangles in `stack` will have a monotonic non-decreasing height. 
		- (NOTE: above is not the exact characterization...because we can't include rectangles were not able to survive earlier indices...also i want the characterization to make it more clear why, left boundary of rectangle corresp to element of stack below it)



More specifically, at index `i`, we have the following possibilities:

1. The `stack` is empty, in which case, we add `(i, heights[i])` into `stack`, i.e., a rectangle starting at `i` of height `heights[i]`.
2. The `stack` is non-empty, and `stack[-1][1] <= heights[i]`, in which case all rectangles in the `stack` will be able to survive `i`, and we don't need to do anything about existing elements in `stack`. We just need to append `(i, heights[i])` to the `stack`.
3. The `stack` is non-empty, and  `stack[-1][1] > heights[i]`, in which case rectangles in `stack` with height larger than `heights[i]` will not be able to survive `i`. So we keep popping the `stack` until it's empty or the last element of the stack has height no larger than `heights[i]`. Each time we pop `stack`, and get an element `(j, m)`, we need to update the `max_area`, because there is a rectangle of height `m` that started at `j` and end at `i - 1`, with area `(i - j) * m`, and it may well be the rectangle with the largest area. Finally, we need to append a rectangle `stack` of height `heights[i]`. To maximize its area, we want to make its starting point as small as possible. The smallest it can be is the starting point of the shortest rectangle that fails to survive `i`, which is the index of the last rectangle we popped from `stack`. So when finish `stack`, we just need to append `(j, heights[i])` to it.

Finally, after iterating over `heights`, whatever that's left in `stack` are all the rectangles that managed to survive the last index of `heights`. So we just need to pop out each element `(j, m)` in `stack`, and check its area `(len(heights) - j) * m` is larger than `max_area`, and update `max_area` accordingly. After this, `max_area` is the desired solution to the problem.

- key observations/intuition
	- a video might be easiest here tbh
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5Sw9130L0
			- i understand, but not sure how to best write this up
			- see if i can use static diagrams to do this best...but not too many scenes
- strategy
	- When the incoming element is smaller than top of the stack, it means the rectangle on top is too tall to extend further right to create a valid rectangle. So this is the best time to solve the area, by taking the width, which will be the position of incoming elements index, minus the index we have for the popped element
	- also: since we know the incoming rectangle is shorter than the one we just popped off, we know it can extend left, so by tracking a left boundary, we can update the left boundary with the index of the popped rectangle, to track how far left we can extend the rectangle.
- strategy
	- i like how this guy describes where each dim of the area is coming from:
		- (note: don't actually need to store all dims of rectangle at index i; storing index i is enough)
			- basically, the stack is storing indices of 'still valid' rectangles, something like that
			- todo: find the exact characterization of this stack, and show why it is very natural
				- it should also make it clear why, when you pop top, the left bound corresp to index of the new top
		- ![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240310121137.png)
- strategy
	- iterate left to right across coords
	- for each rectangle:
		- push if
			- new is taller than top
			- (note: new is taller than empty; ie we push onto empty)
		- pop if
			- new is shorter/same as top
		- pop routine
			- 
- complexity
	- time O(n) amortized
		- iterate on each rectangle at most twice: to push and pop from stack
	- space O(n)
		- for the stack



---

- implementation variant
	- strategy
		- similar idea, but just compute all areas at the end, instead of each time you pop
		- means that when you pop, you store the left and right bounds for that item, so you can compute area later
	- this means the key idea of this approach isnt about when you compute the area; it's about how you compute the bounds
		- also, what rectangle is associated with these bounds
		- it's the max rectangle that contains this rectangle!
		- so what this approach is doing: a linear time way to compute the max rectangle containing rectangle i
	- see:
		- ![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240310115544.png)
