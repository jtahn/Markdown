[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return _the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227103747.png)  
**Input:** `heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`  
**Output:** `10`  
**Explanation:** The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.  
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227103823.png)  
**Input:** `heights = [2,4]`  
**Output:** `4`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

# Brute force
(to [techniques, two pointer vs sliding window](../Blurbs/techniques,%20two%20pointer%20vs%20sliding%20window.md))
- a brute force solution is not obvious
	- when this happens...i wonder if this suggests (ie if a common 'trick' is) that we need to think of some kind of equivalent characterization for a solution?
- and a common trick for 'equivalent characterizations' seems to be:
	- see if we can define a solution (a, not the, bc there might be multiple) in terms of the extrema (max/min) over a set of items, where each item is associated to a member of "the main set we can iterate over in this problem" (which for this problem, would be `heights`)
	- this might not work; but it seems, if the problem has a linear time solution, then there is a way to phrase a key observation via the above trick
- anyways, once you have the characterization: then it seems, you basically just figure out to iterate over/generate the 'indexed items'
	- one of the ways to iterate will be a brute force approach
	- if a linear time solution exists, then there should be a way to iterate where you do at most 2 passes per dimension of the array
	- depending on the problem (ie this one), there might be a way where you only have to do 1 pass per dim

- actually...a brute force is obvious
	- for every pair of boundaries: (count n^2)
		- figure out min height in within these boundaries
		- this determines the max rectangle/area with these boundaries

# Observation
- let `R` be a rectangle whose area is a solution to the problem
- what is an equivalent characterization of `R`?
- lets define some properties; and then see if we can combine properties to characterize `R`
	- note `R` needs to be contained within all rectangles
	- also note `R` fully contains at least 1 rectangle
		- otherwise, you could raise it's height by 1, and it'd still be contained in all rectangles, but the area would be larger...aka contradiction
- note:
	- let `R_i` be the largest rectangle contained within all rectangles, that contains the rectangle at index `i`
		- equivalently: rectangle at index `i` is the smallest bar of `R_i`
		- claim: `R_i` is well-defined..i.e. there is only 1 such rectangle
		- pf: 'obvious' (todo...figure it out)
- claim: 
	- the max of the `R_i` can be chosen as `R`
	- proof:
		- 

- maybe better:
	- Try to find the longest width w.r.t. `height[i]`, which means we have to find the most left (called `start`) and right (called `end`) positions where the all the heights between `[start, end]` are greater or equal to `height[i]`
		- ie this is exactly the 'max rectangle containing `height[i]`'

For a specific bar `A[i]`, to form the largest rectangle we can form using `A[i]`, we need to find the previous and next smaller element.




For each bar, we can expand outwards to find the max width of the rectangle that uses the bar’s height.
Expand Left and Right: Starting from the current bar, expand outwards (both to the left and right) until you find a bar shorter than the current one. 



NOTE: all of the above..needs to be worded slightly differently..the key observation needs to work for both the 2 passes and 1 passes



# 2 passes
- observation
	- the strategy is:
		- for each index, find the associated rectangle
		- aka for each index
			- find the first strictly lower element on each side
			- you could obvi do this via brute force:
				- for each bar, look left and right for first strictly lower element
			- but note: for each side, can treat each direction as an instance of [739. Daily Temperatures](739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md). we know optimal solution is:
				- stacks (equivalently, 'array jumpin' ie 'DP'..tho doesn't feel like DP)
		








## stacks version

 if we find a smaller element than those in stack, then simply pop those greater elements from stack as if the new element is smaller than them , then it would be the first to cause any hinderance to further element and the elements in stack would be useless


```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        # left boundary => next smaller element to left
        stack = []
        nextSmallerLeft = [0]*n
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] >= heights[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                nextSmallerLeft[i] = stack[-1] + 1
            stack.append(i)
        
        # right boundary => next smaller element to right
        stack = []
        nextSmallerRight = [n-1]*n
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] >= heights[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                nextSmallerRight[i] = stack[-1] - 1
            stack.append(i)
        
        res = heights[0]
        for i in range(n):
            height = heights[i]
            weidth = nextSmallerRight[i] - nextSmallerLeft[i] + 1
            area = height * weidth
            res = max(res, area)
            
        return res
```

For a specific bar `A[i]`, to form the largest rectangle we can form using `A[i]`, we need to find the previous and next smaller element.

Assume their indexes are `prevSmaller[i]` and `nextSmaller[i]` respectively. So, `A[prevSmaller[i]]` is the index of the closest element to left of `A[i]` that is smaller than `A[i]`, and `A[nextSmaller[i]]` is the index of the closest element to the right of `A[i]` that is smaller than `A[i]`.

Use monotonic stack to get these `prevSmaller` and `nextSmaller`arrays.

Then for each `A[i]`, the area of the max rectangle we can form using `A[i]` is `(nextSmaller[i] - prevSmaller[i] - 1) * A[i]`.

In this implementation, we can precompute `nextSmaller` array and compute `prevSmaller` values on the fly.


```
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& A) {
    
        int N = A.size(), ans = 0;
        vector<int> nextSmaller(N);
        stack<int> s; // strictly-increasing mono-stack
        
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (s.size() && A[i] <= A[s.top()]) s.pop();
			// log nextSmaller for the current `i` on push
            nextSmaller[i] = s.size() ? s.top() : N; 
            s.push(i);
        }
        
        s = {};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            while (s.size() && A[i] <= A[s.top()]) s.pop();
            int prevSmaller = s.size() ? s.top() : -1;
            ans = max(ans, (nextSmaller[i] - prevSmaller - 1) * A[i]);
            s.push(i);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

variant:
- stack is non-decreasing instead of strictly-increasing
	- ie equality allowed
- answer gets computed in a separate loop
	- instead of during the backwards pass

```
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& A) {
        int N = A.size(), ans = 0;
        vector<int> prev(N, -1), next(N, N);
        stack<int> s; // non-decreasing mono-stack
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            while (s.size() && A[i] < A[s.top()]) {
                next[s.top()] = i; // log `next` of elements in stack on pop
                s.pop();
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        
        s = {};
        
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (s.size() && A[i] < A[s.top()]) {
                prev[s.top()] = i;
                s.pop();
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            ans = max(ans, A[i] * (next[i] - prev[i] - 1));
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```




## 'array jumping'
- todo...is this really dynamic progrmaming? if so, edit jargon in [739. Daily Temperatures](739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md) as well


We can use DP to compute the `prevSmaller` and `nextSmaller` arrays.

This is an `O(N)` solution because each computed `prevSmaller`/`nextSmaller` value is used at most once when computing a new `prevSmaller`/`nextSmaller` value.


```
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& A) {
    
        int N = A.size(), ans = 0;
        vector<int> prevSmaller(N, -1), nextSmaller(N, N);
        
        for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            int j = i + 1;
            
            while (j < N && A[j] >= A[i]) {
	            j = nextSmaller[j];
	            nextSmaller[i] = j;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
            int j = i - 1;
            
            while (j >= 0 && A[j] >= A[i]) {
	            j = prevSmaller[j];
	            prevSmaller[i] = j;        
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
			ans = max(ans, (nextSmaller[i] - prevSmaller[i] - 1) * A[i]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```







# 1 pass


```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        stack = []  # pair: (index, height)

        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > h:
                index, height = stack.pop()
                maxArea = max(maxArea, height * (i - index))
                start = index
            stack.append((start, h))
	
        for i, h in stack:			
            maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (len(heights) - i))
        return maxArea

```





- observation
	- when you compare, and decide to pop: this actually lets you update/compute 2 bounds at the same time
		- one side of the thing you just popped
		- the other side of the thing you just compared it to

- no i dont think the above is the correct intuition...for this method...
	- basically, i'm trying to figure out why this approach can use 1 stack, but the other approaches uses 2
		- actually it uses only 1 stack
		- it's 2 PASSES, not 2 STACKS

- ok i think the key diff for the 1 pass approach vs the 2 pass approach is just:
	- what exactly are we trying to track with the stack
	- for 2 passes: the stack is helping us track, 'first strictly lower element'
		- (remember, better way is reverse iteration)
		- so when we want: first strictly lower element to the right
			- we iterate backwards/left
			- at each moment, stack holds all/the only elements that could possibly be the first strictly lower element
	- for 1 pass: the stack is tracking: 'currently valid rectangles'
		- at each moment/index, the stack holds...
		- whatever i say above...it needs to also imply why, we are able to know that the left boundary of the rectangle extends all the way to the item right under it
		- 

- at/after index j, the stack contains indices `i` (or objects corresp to index `i`) where:
	- the rectangle that contains `h[i]` and can be extended through `h[j]`
		- note: this auto implies that the stack has to be non-decreasing
		- how do i define it so that the stack is strictly increasing
			- aka: above means that if i have same adjacent heights, they would stay in the stack
			- i don't want that
	- "the unique rectangle containing `h[i]` that can be extended through `h[j]`
		- this doesn't rly make sense tbh...
	- exists a rectangle where first instance from the right of its lowest height is `h[i]`, and can be extended through `h[j]`
		- yes!
			- well the wording needs to be significantly cleaned up....how do i do better...
			- "the rectangle that contains `h[i]` can be extended through `h[j]`, and `h[i]` is it's height, and `h[i]` is the most rightward place where this height occurs (as of index `j`)"
		- this implies strictly increasing (it's pretty obvious; not totally obvious; but i don't think i can do better)
		- and does it imply that, the left bound of a stack item, has to corresp to index of item right below it?
			- yes, but its not obvious at all...i think i need a better definition??
			- pf: if index was earlier: then this would imply there should be a stack item here; bc this 'missing' height is involved with a rectangle could be extended to `h[j]` as well (because its shorter than `h[i]`, which was able to be extended) and is different from the stack item there rn, bc its shorter...
			- i think easier way to prove is probably: 
				- show that ALL the 'missing indices' `k` btwn these two stack items `top` and `below`...satisfy `h[below] < h[k] <= h[top]`. which means that `h[top]` can be extended all the way through `h[below+1]`
					- this should be easy to prove...but imo not worth typing up rn..i think this is way too involved....there should be something cleaner?


---


- general observations that might be useful in the future?
	- (i think this is useless tbh..probly delete..it's just way too vague)
	- One way to think of how the monotonic stack/queue technique can be applied is to imagine how you can benefit from using increasing or decreasing sequence and what could you calculate having that sequence.



---


Initialize an empty `stack` and iterate over the elements in `heights`. Suppose we are at index `i`, we can construct `stack` in such a way that it contains all the rectangles that started at an index `j <= i`, and can survive `i` (i.e., `height[j] <= height[i]`). By construction, the rectangles in `stack` will have a monotonic non-decreasing height. More specifically, at index `i`, we have the following possibilities:


(NOTE: above is not the exact characterization...because we can't include rectangles were not able to survive earlier indices...also i want the characterization to make it more clear why, left boundary of rectangle corresp to element of stack below it)

1. The `stack` is empty, in which case, we add `(i, heights[i])` into `stack`, i.e., a rectangle starting at `i` of height `heights[i]`.
2. The `stack` is non-empty, and `stack[-1][1] <= heights[i]`, in which case all rectangles in the `stack` will be able to survive `i`, and we don't need to do anything about existing elements in `stack`. We just need to append `(i, heights[i])` to the `stack`.
3. The `stack` is non-empty, and  `stack[-1][1] > heights[i]`, in which case rectangles in `stack` with height larger than `heights[i]` will not be able to survive `i`. So we keep popping the `stack` until it's empty or the last element of the stack has height no larger than `heights[i]`. Each time we pop `stack`, and get an element `(j, m)`, we need to update the `max_area`, because there is a rectangle of height `m` that started at `j` and end at `i - 1`, with area `(i - j) * m`, and it may well be the rectangle with the largest area. Finally, we need to append a rectangle `stack` of height `heights[i]`. To maximize its area, we want to make its starting point as small as possible. The smallest it can be is the starting point of the shortest rectangle that fails to survive `i`, which is the index of the last rectangle we popped from `stack`. So when finish `stack`, we just need to append `(j, heights[i])` to it.

Finally, after iterating over `heights`, whatever that's left in `stack` are all the rectangles that managed to survive the last index of `heights`. So we just need to pop out each element `(j, m)` in `stack`, and check its area `(len(heights) - j) * m` is larger than `max_area`, and update `max_area` accordingly. After this, `max_area` is the desired solution to the problem.

- key observations/intuition
	- a video might be easiest here tbh
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx5Sw9130L0
			- i understand, but not sure how to best write this up
			- see if i can use static diagrams to do this best...but not too many scenes
- strategy
	- maintain a monotone increasing stack
		- we can construct `stack` in such a way that it contains all the rectangles that started at an index `j <= i`, and can survive `i` (i.e., `height[j] <= height[i]`). By construction, the rectangles in `stack` will have a monotonic non-decreasing height
- observations
	- Invariant: the stack contains the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at bar i. 
		- this is true, but imo is not the right intuition for this problem...
- strategy
	- When the incoming element is smaller than top of the stack, it means the rectangle on top is too tall to extend further right to create a valid rectangle. So this is the best time to solve the area, by taking the width, which will be the position of incoming elements index, minus the index we have for the popped element
	- also: since we know the incoming rectangle is shorter than the one we just popped off, we know it can extend left, so by tracking a left boundary, we can update the left boundary with the index of the popped rectangle, to track how far left we can extend the rectangle.
- strategy
	- i like how this guy describes where each dim of the area is coming from:
		- (note: don't actually need to store all dims of rectangle at index i; storing index i is enough)
			- basically, the stack is storing indices of 'still valid' rectangles, something like that
			- todo: find the exact characterization of this stack, and show why it is very natural
				- it should also make it clear why, when you pop top, the left bound corresp to index of the new top
		- ![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240310121137.png)
- strategy
	- iterate left to right across coords
	- for each rectangle:
		- push if
			- new is taller than top
			- (note: new is taller than empty; ie we push onto empty)
		- pop if
			- new is shorter/same as top
		- pop routine
			- 
- complexity
	- time O(n) amortized
		- iterate on each rectangle at most twice: to push and pop from stack
	- space O(n)
		- for the stack



## alternate 1
(collapse this into a bullet point and put it above, bc it really is the same solution; just a technique diff)
- alternative implementation
	- strategy
		- similar idea, but just compute all areas at the end, instead of each time you pop
		- means that when you pop, you store the left and right bounds for that item, so you can compute area later
	- this means the key idea of this approach isnt about when you compute the area; it's about how you compute the bounds
		- also, what rectangle is associated with these bounds
		- it's the max rectangle that contains this rectangle!
		- so what this approach is doing: a linear time way to compute the max rectangle containing rectangle i
	- see:
		- ![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240310115544.png)
		- ![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240310115603.png)


## alternate 2
(another alternative implementation; also collapse into a bullet and put into main writeup for this technique)

- he uses some kind trick, seems the purpose is to avoid base case of stack being empty..
