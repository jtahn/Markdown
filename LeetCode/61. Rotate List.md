[61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151840.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[4,5,1,2,3]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151849.png)  
**Input:** `head = [0,1,2], k = 4`  
**Output:** `[2,0,1]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9`

## #linked_lists/fastslow 
- the other common 'fast and slow pointers' trick:
	- fast gets a headstart
	- then you simultaneously move fast and slow, to have slow end at desired interior node
- in particular:  #linked_lists/subroutines/find_jth_node 
	- 'find `j`th node' is a fundamental linked list subroutine
		- implemented via fast pointer with headstart of `n-j` steps
		- then slow node = `j`th node

- so here, to find `n-k`th node:
	- head start of `k` steps

## assorted linked list stuff

- another example of problem that's mainly about:
	- determine which nodes need pointer updates
	- (and which nodes involved in those updates)
	- use fundamental linked list subroutines

---

- determine which nodes need pointer updates
	- old tail: to old head
	- new tail: to none
- determine what nodes we need
	- all nodes involved in pointer updates
	- new head (we return this)
- determine subroutines to find the required nodes
	- subroutine to find new head and new tail
		- note: will also gives us the old tail


- strat
	- first update `k` via mod `n`
	- identify how this relates to the important interior nodes
		- rotating by `k` means:
			- the `n-k`th node is the new tail
			- and it points to new head
	- so now apply subroutine to find new tail, aka `n-k`th node
		- in particular, will give us:
			- slow is new tail
			- slow.next is new head
			- fast is at end of list, aka old tail
	- now update pointers


# Strategies


## linked list concepts


- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- we just do a few linear passes
		- and all operations inside the passes are O(1)
	- O(1) space

```python
class Solution:
8    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
10        if head is None or head.next is None:
11            return head
12      
14        cur, n = head, 0
15        while cur:
16            n += 1
17            cur = cur.next
20        k %= n
21        if k == 0:
22            return head
23
25        fast = slow = head
28        for _ in range(k):
29            fast = fast.next
32        while fast.next:
33            fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next
34      
          new_tail, new_head, old_tail = slow, slow.next, fast
          new_tail.next, old_tail.next = None, old_head

41        return new_head
```
