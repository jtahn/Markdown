[234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        
```

# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` _if it is a palindrome or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A **palindrome** is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151225.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,2,1]`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151235.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2]`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?

## #python/assignment 
- parallel/multiple assignment can make code more readable + safe
	- when you have a bunch separate assignments bc you just want to update a bunch of stuff for next iteration:
		- imo parallel assignment makes it more clear that this is what you're doing
		- ESPECIALLY because you then don't have to worry about order of assignment statements (bc you're often re-using variables)
	- aka big benefit of parallel/multiple:
		- iirc python evaluates right side first; and then does all assignment
	- examples
		- [[234. Palindrome Linked List]]
			- making code more readable AND safe
				- in second routine: if you do separate assignment, then `pre` needs to be assigned before you assign `cur`
				- bc you want to assign `pre` to the current value of `cur`, not it's next value


## #linked_lists/subroutines 
- it seems a big pattern in linked list problems, is separating your desired algo into a bunch of diff steps that you know how to handle
	- ie finding middle; reversing
	- see box in [[_secondary/01 competitive programming/epi.pdf#page=124&offset=-115,654,0|epi, Linked lists boot camp]]
		- another confidence boost that i think i have the right mindset/way to think about problems...feels like i basically am just already stating/observing everything that epi says about linked lists
- i think it's exactly bc, linked list just have very little structure/methods you have access to
	- so the 'algos' on linked list are really just about like, building up an understanding of the 'fundamental subroutines' that are implemented using literally the only 2 operations you have:
		- traversal
		- flipping pointers

- aka the 'difficulty' of linked list problems is probly just like:
	- being aware of all the essential subroutines/tricks
	- figuring out how to chain them
	- managing what aux structures you need to clone/save from previous subroutines, for later subroutines
		- bc sometimes, a subroutine requires stuff generated from a way earlier subroutine; not just the immediately preceding subroutine 




# Strategies



## subroutines

- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space

- strat
	- find middle (second middle if even)
		- we know: via fast and slow
		- [[876. Middle of the Linked List]]
	- reverse second/right half
		- from middle, continue traversing forward, but now also flip pointers
	- compare front and reversed second half
		- simultaneously traverse

- now think about what aux structures/variables (if any) that each step needs from past steps
	- (ie, bc there are similar problems where like, we need to define/store an aux node before we start the second routine, that doesn't get modified, bc we need it for the third routine)
	- 'reversal' needs middle of the link list
		- alrdy provided by 'slow' from previous routine
	- 'compare' needs start of reversed second half
		- aka end of og second half
		- alrdy provided by 'reversal' routine, bc this is the last node that gets modified/flipped
	- so we actually don't need any aux structures, aside from what is alrdy directly used in each routine


```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
	    # find middle
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
            
        # reverse
        pre, cur = None, slow.next
        while cur:
            temp = cur.next
            cur.next = pre
            pre, cur = cur, temp
            
        # compare
        left, right = head, pre
        while right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left, right = left.next, right.next
        return True
