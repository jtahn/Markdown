https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `n = 5, bad = 4`
**Output:** `4`
**Explanation:**
```
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `n = 1, bad = 1`
**Output:** `1`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, n
        while l < r:
            v = (l + r) // 2
            if isBadVersion(v):
                r = v
            else:
                l = v + 1
        return l
```

- can do iterative or recursive

left=1 (not 0; bc versions start at 1)
right=n


idea: first bad version is always within inclusive range `[left,right]`

while left<right:

run api call on mid:
then you adjust ranges based on "all the versions after a bad version are also bad":

- if mid is bad (then first bad is here at the latest), then replace right with mid; so new range is `[left,mid]`
- if mid is good (then anything before mid is also good), then replace left with mid+1; so new range is `[mid+1,right]`


once `left==right`, return either


## overflow

apparently python wont overflow; but java,cpp can

avoid overflow error in other languages:
mid = left + (right-left) // 2

instead of
mid = (left + right) // 2

(because left+right might be above the int max)

or rather, it seems you might get stuck in an infinite loop (?)
