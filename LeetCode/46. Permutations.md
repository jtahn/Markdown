[46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

```

# Description

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return _all the possible permutations_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
**Output:** `[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,1]`  
**Output:** `[[0,1],[1,0]]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1]`  
**Output:** `[[1]]`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 6`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.

- Brute force
	- generates permutations by first creating all size 1 permutations, then all size 2 permutations, and so on.
	- This approach requires vast amounts of space complexity
		- need to store all permutations of size n-1, to create size n perms
		- aka space complexity `O((n-1)!)`
- Backtracking
	- builds each permutation and adds it to the solution list
		- note these don't count against space complexity, bc they're part of final solution
	- so space is only used for the 'building current perm' structure
		- aka just O(n)
- i bet: time complexity likely won't be much different for both approaches




#/todo 
- rewrite code
	- follow skiena template on p283
		- 'subsets' problem should be fundy for this + cite skiena
		- bc probly the easiest backtracking problem
	- imo just default to using an aux function for any dfs implementation (thus, backtracking)
	- probly also rewrite for
		- [[46. Permutations]]
		- [[39. Combination Sum]]




- issues with neetcode example
	- includes an unnecessary optimization that does not improve speed and is not applicable to other problems.
- complexity
	- space
		- need space for 'partial numbers' array
		- O(N)


- probly 2 standard/diff ways to write aux functions
	- option 1:
		- process solution
			- checks if the partial solution is the correct length
				- or if no numbers left to add
			- adds the solution to a list of solutions
				- list of soln: initialized outside the backtrack function
				- cite python: in inner scope, can modify mutable containers defined in enclosing scope
		- construct candidates
			- based on numbers that haven't been used in current partial solution
			- as we traverse/backtrack:
				- make move: add number to partial solution
				- unmake move: pop number from partial solution
	- option 2
		- combo of skiena template + improve the aux function
			- 'improve' aka usually 'more efficient' by adding parameters
		- parameters: current solution, array of unused numbers


- actually i'm not a fan of neetcode, bc it's like basically going backwards imo...
	- or like, the way it goes through the search tree isn't 'natural'; it's like flipping the tree in a way that is more confusing, and not really better
	- bc still same space complexity: bc implicitly use from recursion call stack
		- aka no asymptotic benefits from using input array as storage 







# References

## backtracking basics
- see [78. Subsets](78.%20Subsets.md)
	- covers the 'skiena general template for backtracking'
- todo: explain the 'variables' in this problem wrt skiena's template
	- main difference: 'valid next neighbors' are just 'all unused numbers in current partial permutation'


## aux functions in python
- aka inner functions
- instead of passing parameters; can often just modify a mutable container
	- aka take advantage of nonlocal scope
	- ie https://algo.monster/liteproblems/46



# Results

## python deep copy lists
- meta
	- this problem might actually be the fundy
		- bc this might be the first time this comes up?
		- bc other than backtracking, idr having yet encountered other problems/approaches where we need to save 'snapshots' of 'mutating containers' (for backtracking: to add to our 'list of solutions')




# Approaches

- [epi](../_refs/01%20competitive%20programming/epi.pdf#page=295&offset=-115,695,0)

- the neetcode example is not good code!
	- change it to match skiena

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        # base case
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return [nums[:]]  # nums[:] is a deep copy

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            n = nums.pop(0)
            perms = self.permute(nums)

            for perm in perms:
                perm.append(n)
            res.extend(perms)
            nums.append(n)
        return res
