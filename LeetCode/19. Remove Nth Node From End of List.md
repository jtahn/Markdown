# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# Description
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110431.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,5]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `head = [1], n = 1`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `head = [1,2], n = 1`  
**Output:** `[1]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

# References
## dummy node
- (looking for a very simple linked list problem where the dummy node ‘trick’ is useful)
	- aka should probly involve doing an operation on every elt, including head, but 'std approach' involves having a separate 'base case' routine for the head
- aka ‘reason you use this is bc it handles edge cases very cleanly’
	- don’t need to include a separate routine for the head; can just treat it like every other node in the list

- interesting trick: create/append a `dummy` node to the beginning of the list
	- why? so that we do not need special routines to handle edge cases, such as:
		- list only contains one node
		- we need to remove the first node
	- by ensuring that a pointer starts before the `head` of the actual list, we can use the same logic for removing the first node, as we would any other `nth` node
	- After we've completed the removal, we return `dummy.next`, which is the updated list's `head`
	- (not sure if this is 'required tho..doesn't seem to be objectively 'better', at least for this problem)


- memory leaks?
	- be aware: apparently some languages (but likely not python), memory leaks need to be addressed; ie via:

```
result = dummyHead.next
dummyHead.next = None
return result
```







## recursion template
- future: is there a general ‘recursion template’?
	- atm, seems at least 2 big styles for the aux function:
		- simplest: return recursive calls
		- this problem (and others): order of ops:
			- recursive call early in the function
			- routine based on result of the recursive call
			- return result of routine
		- (is the above diff from or does this even exist):
			- routine
			- recursive call
			- return
			- (this seems like nonsense tbh..if routine didnt need the recursive call, then why would you even need a recursive approach)
	- if the third option above exists...is there a similarity between these approaches, and ‘traversal’ orders?
		- ie where like: you do stuff at a node, then traverse; versus traversal call first, then do stuff
			- ie: the above jargon i think is: pre, in, post order
		- i suspect there is a connection? bc iirc recursion corresp to dfs



# Results
## standard tech to traverse a linked list backwards
- we want something that is computed wrt end of the list
	- but linked list: can only traverse forwards
- if there is only one node that you need to do an op on, then a pointer is sufficient



# Implementations


## store nodes in memory
- implementations
	- array
	- recursion
```
# array



# recursion
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        
        def remove(head, n):            
            if head == None: return head, 0

            node, count = remove(head.next, n)
            count += 1
            head.next = node
            
            if count == n: head = head.next
            
            return head, count
        
        return remove(head, n)[0]
```


- all should have same space complexity?

### array
- better than recursion
	- better space when you do the 'only store last n' 'optimization'
	- better time bc recursion has to traverse 'backwards' again up the call stack to do the delete

### recursion

- to explain: possibly sufficient to have code comments:
	- recursive calls: ‘# traverse and store nodes in call stack’
	- base case and computing distance: ‘# compute distance from last’
	- main subroutine: ‘# delete nth node’

- general idea is actually same as brute/direct:
	- traverse to end of list, and keep all prev nodes in memory
		- once you hit end:
			- then start going back in memory until you hit the ninth
		- when you hit ninth:
			- run a routine to delete the node
		- (maybe there’s a better way to write the recursion)
			- bc atm: its implicitly instead of explicitly deleting
			- ie: we implicitly delete by just skipping over the node, when we attach tails
			- im thinking: there might be a way to write recursion, but instead of setting the tail every time; we instead just explicitly delete when we hit nth node?
			- (i feel this ‘implicitly deleting’ is what is making recursion more confusing than it needs to be)
			- otoh..is this a valuable technique/variant to keep around? it feels like it could be...ie maybe have it as a code snippet, and label it ‘implicitly delete’..vs another recursion code example that ‘explicitly deletes’



- relabel variable names for ‘implicit delete’ recursion approach. something like:
	- third line ‘root=rec’: imo call it like: ‘currFront = rec’..ie root should be ‘currfront’
	- and reliable “cur’ to be ‘currBack’
	- (ehh this isnt the best..surely better names)
		- maybe something about ‘traverse’ and...idk
	- point is: names should help indicate: certain ‘curr’ nodes are for traversing/storing
		- and others are for the ‘linking/implicit deleting’ step


---

- intuition
	- the first step are recursive calls
		- so this immediately builds a recursion call stack
		- forwards pass through the list
		- ie bottom of the stack are calls made earlier in the list
			- top of stack are calls made later 
		- ie a node’s call is right below it’s tails call
		- note: each node will point to what it’s tail returns
	- so: the function calls will execute/return in reverse/backwards order through the list
		- ie cascade back
	- calls cascade forwards; returns/routine/”tail setting” occurs backwards
	- what will the tail return?
		- bc of call stack structure:
		- we should figure this out by working backwards
		- bc first time the full function will execute, is the call at top of stack
		- aka call corresp to last node
		- last node just returns itself and 0
			- the 0 corresp to fact that it’s distance 0 from end of list
			- (rewrite code so it’s more readable/clear/aligns with explanation)
		- now we see why this works:
			- other nodes will return itself and distance
		- only ‘interesting thing’ happens when a node realizes it is distance n
			- then it returns it’s tail (so that it’s head will now skip this node)
			- as desired!
		- aka the distance is returned, so that a node knows when it should skip itself

- recursively determine the indexes
- helper function
	- removes the nth node
	- returns two values
		- The index
		- the possibly changed head of the remaining list.



## find max length
```
"""no dummy node"""
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
	ptr, length = head, 0
	while ptr:
		ptr, length = ptr.next, length + 1
	if length == n : return head.next
	ptr = head
	for i in range(1, length - n):
		ptr = ptr.next
	ptr.next = ptr.next.next
	return head
```
- observation
	- if there are `L` nodes; then after prepending a dummy node, it takes `L` steps to traverse the list
	- examples imply that the "1st node from the end" is the last node
	- so if we want to delete the 1st node from the end, we take `L-1` steps, and delete this node's reference
	- if we want to delete the nth node from the end, we take `L-n` steps, and delete this node's reference
- strategy
	- prepend `dummy` node
	- traverse entire list to count ttl steps `L` (including dummy)
	- traverse `L-n` steps, and modify this node's pointer; ie change `curr.next`
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space

## lagging pointer
```
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        left = dummy
        right = head

        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1

        while right:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        # delete
        left.next = left.next.next
        return dummy.next

"""no dummy node"""
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        fast = slow = head
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
- summary
	- 2 pointers/iterators: let one of them start at the beginning, another at index `n`
		- equivalently: start the second pointer when the first one has traversed n nodes
	- then when the second one is finished, the first one will be on the right place
- strategy
	- maintaining two pointers that we'll call `fast` and `slow`
	- The `fast` pointer advances `n` nodes into the list first
	- Then, both `slow` and `fast` pointers move at the same pace until `fast` reaches the end of the list
		- At this point, `slow` will be right before the node we want to remove
		- update `slow.next` to skip the target node
- complexity
	- time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the list, as we traverse the list with two pointers in a single pass.
		- Time complexity is `O(L)`, more precisely we make `2L-n` steps, where `L` is length of list, space complexity is `O(1)`. So it the end it is exactly the same as staightforward two passes solution. So, if you meet this problem in real interview, you can just explain two pass solution, and when interviewer say can you do better: explain him that another one pass solution in fact is exaclty the same time and space.
	- space complexity is O(1) since no additional space is required aside from the pointers, and the 


- Since we will need access to the node before the target node in order to remove the target node, we can use fast.next == null as our exit condition, rather than fast == null, so that we stop one node earlier.



- note: this variant isn't really "one pass"
	- whenever I see a two pointers trick I always think -- what about the number of operations performed by this code? Don't you still end up moving the faster pointer as many times as there are nodes in the list and the slow pointer as many times as it needs to get to the n from last node? So it seems like there's no real gain in efficiency here -- there are still two passes, the second pass is just hidden in the code. (Having two actual passes would touch each node in the list as many times.)
	- This solution is two pass... the first and second pointers are each one pass
