[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224212822.png)  
**Input:** `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`  
**Output:** `9`  

**Constraints:**
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

# Observations

- boundaries for disjoint sets of trapped water will be monotone increasing, then monotone decreasing



# Brute force
- strategy
	- for each bar
		- find global max to left and right
		- subtract itself from min (global max left, global max right)
		- this value is amt of water that can be trapped directly above it
	- so the answer is the sum of all these values
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
		- we iterate over each bar
		- for each bar, we iterate over array to check for global maxes
	- O(1) space

# dynamic programming
- strategy
	- from brute force: observe that this 'check for global max left and global max right' can actually be done at the beginning
		- create arrays to store global max left and right for each node
		- forwards pass to determine global max lefts
			- at each node, global max left is the highest height encountered so far
		- backwards pass to determine global max rights
			- same
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- but now, O(n) space

# Two pointer (best)

```
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax, rightMax = height[l], height[r]
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                res += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
```

- possible intuition
	- from DP: the fact that global maxes at each node can be computed in one pass..maybe suggests that two pointer should let us achieve the same thing, but without space complexity
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- we only traverse the array once
	- O(1) space
		- only current pointers and current left/right maxes


alternative way to write the main logic:

- the trapped water height depends on the smaller of the maxes
- then move pointer on the side of the smaller max
	- why does it not work to move the pointer on the side of the larger max??? i think below discussions answers that:

# Stacks


note: alternatively, stack should just have indices; bc then `height[x]` is the height at that index

diagram of how we want to approach problem:
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226115903.png)


- intuition for main logic
	- when you meet an increasing height: to determine trapped water involving this new height, you don't need every height on it's left that's lower; you only need the strictly INCREASING monotone sequence of heights as you pass to the left
		- aka corresp to a stack that is monotone DECREASING if you consider walls as you pass to the right
		- imo it's easier to understand what's going on by looking at code


- similar to "84 largest rectangle in histogram"
	- todo: understand why stacks are optimal there; ie why you cannot use 2 pointer solution (optimal here) in that problem
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space
- intuition
	- the brute/dp/2p approaches
		- the idea was figuring out what the VERTICAL area of water is, at an index
	- versus this approach:
		- figuring out how to characterize HORIZONTAL areas of water at a node: one way is:
		- first note: don't do a computation at every node. have to figure out when you decide to do a computation
			- aka when water is trapped
		- at each index, fill out horizontal areas of water to the left of it
		- ie if you look from left to right: water gets trapped once an increasing height appears; as more increasing heights appear, you get more water trapped, so the problem here is how to deal with duplicate computations
			- do this via stack; ie point of stack is to prevent duplicate computations; ie only keeping track of decreasing heights that you havent computed with, somehow
	- decreasing stack
		- basically you will use this to fill 'horizontal' areas of water
		- stack needs to store indices, bc trapped water computation depends on 'width'
	- iterate over nodes from left to right
		- while new height is greater than top of stack
			- pop off the stack, and compute the wide area of water
		- once new height is smaller than top of stack, just append to stack
- errors
	- i don't think increasing stack can work here
		- bc the idea is: if you have an increasing stack, then some sort of computation needs to happen when you meet a height that is LESS THAN top of stack, and then you KEEP POPPING stuff off the stack until this height can be put on top of stack
		- but the problem is: after the first pop: there's possibly no water computation to do with the next height you pop: bc both heights are going to be less than the first height you popped; like they could corresp to completely disjoint bodies of trapped water, if that first pop is the global max height
