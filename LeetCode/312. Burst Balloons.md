 [312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `i^th` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [3,1,5,8]`  
**Output:** `167`  
**Explanation:**  
```
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,5]`  
**Output:** `10`  

**Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Errata 
When you burst a balloon, then the rest of the balloons get 'shifted over'. See example 1.

#/jargon 
- should i call this errata? or clarifications?

- #/fundy striver says these are important prereq problems
	- matrix chain multiplication (mcm)
		- not sure if leetcode directly has it
		- actually it seems 'burst balloons' is THE standard/default use of it
			- https://medium.com/swlh/template-for-solving-matrix-chain-multiplication-mcm-problem-in-dp-6c18d94adcc5
			- ie this might literally be mcm
		- [1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon/)
			- Actually this problem looks quite troublesome at first, after we dive in, we will find out that this problem is actually a deformed version of `Matrix Chain Multiplication`. For example, `[1,2,3,4]` can be viewed as 3 matrix multiplication `(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)`. what is the minimum operations to multiply all these three matrices.

	- 8:00 the key thing about this problem is: the naive/initial way you'd try to split into subproblems, is invalid..bc 'independence'. 
		- CLRS discusses this
			- move to #dynamic_programming/independence below
		- #/jargon what do ppl say for 'naive'/'initial'
		- i also need to figure out why the 'naive' way IS the 'naive' way:
			- i think bc there is probly a pattern:
				- if you can choose to start wherever in an array
				- then typically you analyze what happens/split into left and right subproblems
		- so point is that: bc balloons are shifted: we cannot split into left and right subproblems
			- aka 'dependence'
			- i need to explain this correctly. i think it is:
				- (confirm with CLRS)
				- the outcomes of bursting balloons in left subproblem, depends on how you burst balloons in right subproblem
					- ie  in the left subp: hwat happens when we burst b3?
					- answer is: we need to know what happens in the right subp
						- no contribution from the right, if both b4 and b5 burst before b3
						- b4 contributes if relative burst order is b5,b3,b4
						- b5 contributes if relative burst order is b4, b3, b5
					- 
	- 11:00 striver's inspo:
		- go in opposite direction:
			- analyze sequence starting from 'last balloon burst'
		- (idk if this is the true inspo...in the leetcode forums discussion, ppl mentioned something that seemed like a really good inspo...ie not focusing on bursting a blloon, but pairs of balloons)

- i think chatgpt correctly summarized the subproblem definition, but the base cases + actual iterative solution process might be incorrect. bc it doesn't match up with MCM from CLRS

#/fundy 
- i think maybe i should also have discussions of 'dimensions' of dp problems
	- this was in one of my refs
	- bc this is a good example where problem is 1d, but storage structure is 2d
	- versus other problems that are like, 2d input but 0d storage (constant space, ie only need like 1 or 2 prev subproblem states)







#/maybe 
- it seems this problem brings up a lot of important subtleties when trying to determine subproblems
	- subproblem space needs to be polynomial for the algo to be reasonable
		- ie could think of 'popping a balloon' as removing it, and analyze the rest
		- but the number of subproblems is then 2^n
		- bc subproblem = subset of the balloons
			- and there are 2^n subsets (each balloon, can include or not include)
		- iirc skiena and clrs and others, all mention this...so cite it
	- subproblems need to actually be 'valid'
		- both tuf and neetcode mention that you cannot 'independently' look at the left and right subsets when you pop a balloon

	- matrix chain multiplication
	- seems to be a classic example of DP
		- or rather, example of the "partition DP" pattern
		- seems the generalization:
			- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication#Generalizations
				- The matrix chain multiplication problem generalizes to solving a more abstract problem: given a linear sequence of objects, an associative binary operation on those objects, and a way to compute the cost of performing that operation on any two given objects (as well as all partial results), compute the minimum cost way to group the objects to apply the operation over the sequence.
	- #/fundy the intro of the vid mentions that there are a bunch of other standard patterns, and confirmed by looking at titles in the dp playlist:
		- 1d, 2d, grids, subsequences, strings, stocks, partition
			- btw when we say 'subsequences, strings, stocks': try to figure out exactly what about these types of problems is different
				- like they have different 'types of constraints'
				- these names are just used as shorthand/abbreviation for the class/patterns of constraints/structure
				- they will have overlap with 1d and 2d btw
					- bc these are just 'dimension'
					- also does 1d and 2d refer to the problem statement..or to the resulting dp?
				- aka i think i need to figure out: 'best way' to divide most dp problems into 'patterns'..and there might be more than 1 helpful way that i should know
			- i can think of this like binary search..where there's a bunch of key variants/patterns that i need to know, but every problem basically falls under these patterns
				- ie within each major pattern, there are subpatterns


- be aware of faster algos
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication#More_efficient_algorithms
		- wait, this seems to confirm that i should do 1039? and put this algo for that problem

# Results

## #dynamic_programming/independence 




- excellent comment on leetcode
	- point is:
		- need to figure out how to interpret problem in a way that allows for independence
		- i need an explanation for how we would even think of the below approach though
	- NEVER MIND!
		- there is a 'natural progression' to interpret balloons / realize the way to create independent subproblems
			- and it is by considering 'balloon popped last'
			- or actually: by considering 'ranges of balloons'
				- yea THIS is what it is
				- 'ranges of balloons' handles the dependencies
				- #/fundy i'm almost certain that 'ranges' is one of the common DP patterns mentioned in dpv
					- [[../_refs/02 algorithms/dpv.pdf#page=176&selection=6,0,6,18|dpv, page 176]]
					- i tihnk the way to explain this will be:
						- cannot use 'common subproblem pattern X' bc dependence
							- actually: seems dpv never defines 'left and right' as a pattern
						- so use 'pattern Y' bc takes care of independence bc Z
			- and essentially becomes equivalent process of how to figure out MCM subproblem structure
		- the leetcode comment is explaining how to figure out 'equivalence' btwn balloons and MCM..but imo, this isn't how i should think of the problem
			- i still think MCM worth adding, bc its good practice with defining subproblems via 'ranges'
			- 
			- #/fundy !! CLRS discusses an 'incorrect' way to define subproblem structure for MCM, bc lack of independence iirc...so use that discussion to inform how i discuss independence here as well
				- and also use the 'longest path problem' that CLRS uses for independce...that will likely be the 'main fundy' for independence
				- and then balloons and MCM will be examples of it
				- 
- leetcode discussion comment:
	- If you think of bursting a balloon as multiplying two adjacent matrices, then this problem is exactly the classical DP problem Matrix-chain multiplication found in section 15.2 in the book Introduction to Algorithms (2nd edition). For example, given [3,5,8] and bursting 5, the number of coins you get is the number of scalar multiplications you need to do to multiply two matrices A[3*5] and B[5*8]. So in this example, the original problem is actually the same as given a matrix chain A[1*3]*B[3*5]*C[5*8]*D[8*1], fully parenthesize it so that the total number of scalar multiplications is maximized, although the orignal matrix-chain multiplication problem in the book asks to minimize it.
