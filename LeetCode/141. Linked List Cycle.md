[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

# Description
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224215828.png)  
**Input:** `head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).  

**Example 2:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224215833.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2], pos = 0`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.  

**Example 3:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224215848.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1], pos = -1`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.  

**Constraints:**
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

# References
## hashmaps for existence

## floyd (aka tortoise and hare)


## python reference basics

- the function `sys.getrefcount(obj)` tells you how many references an object has
	- minimum, 3 references 
		- https://groverlab.org/hnbfpr/2017-06-22-fun-with-sys-getrefcount.html
		- ie big integers/classes
		- comes from:
			- 1 ref comes from the calling of this function itself according to the documentation
			- 2 Refs from the object being created, compiled and stored for optimization



# Approaches
## check if already visited
- implementations
	- set/Hashing
```
# set
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
	    visited = set()
	    curr = head
	    while curr:
		    if curr in visited:
			    return True
			else:
				visited.add(curr)
				curr = curr.next
		return False		    
```

- strategy
	- use a set to keep track of visited nodes
- note
	- don't need dict; a set is sufficient
		- we only care about membership (ie if we've visited or not; we dont need to know "when" it was visited/"where" the node is)
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- each node visited once
	- O(n) space
		- storing visited nodes


## floyd aka tortoise & hare
```
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False



"""EAFP instead of LBYL"""
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
	    try:
		    slow = head
		    fast = head.next
			while slow is not fast:
				slow = slow.next
				fast = fast.next.next
			return True
		except AttributeError as e:
			return False
```

- jargon
	- Floyd's (cycle-finding) algo
	- tortoise and hare
- strategy
	- slow and fast pointer`
	- if `fast` or `fast.next` ever hits `None`
		- then there's no cycle
		- so we use a while loop for this
	- otherwise, there is a cycle
		- (because finite linked list)
		- aka this is an iff relationship
		- also: aka stuck in the while loop
- observation
	- claim: 
		- if there is a cycle, the fast pointer will catch up to the slow pointer in O(n) time
	- proof
		- if there is a cycle, then eventually both pointers will reach/enter/be stuck in the cycle
		- when both pointers are in the cycle: the hare meet the tortoise, AND it will happen in O(N) time
			- within loop: say the hare is "m" steps behind the tortoise
			- bc hare moves by 2 and tortoise by 1: this mean at each iteration, the hare closes gap by 1
			- so takes count m iterations for hare to catch up
			- m is at most n, aka length of linked list
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- O(n) for pointers to reach the cycle
		- O(n) for pointers to meet in the cycle (see arg above)
	- O(1) space
- python 'optimization': EAFP rather than LBYL
	- the floyd code checks for existence of `fast` and `fast.next`
		- no need to check for existence of `slow`, bc fast scopes out that stuff before slow
		- these fast existence checks are unnecessary as well, bc python checks anyways
	- aka handle existence via an exception



## Python builtins for references
```
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
	    import sys

	    while head:
		    if sys.getrefcount(head) > 4:
			    return True

		    head = head.next

	    return False

"""pochmann golfing but actually in a cool way"""
def hasCycle(self, head):
    while sys.getrefcount(head) < 5:
        head = head.next
    return bool(head)
```
- observation
	- Says.get ref count always has 3 refs
		- we get 1 more ref from the previous node's next
		- node is a start of the cycle IFF it has another reference to it (so 5 total)
- the only reason I’m keeping this here, is bc in python, this is apparently more efficient
