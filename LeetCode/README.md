# LeetCode ToC[^order][^unfinished]
[^order]: starts with [neetcode150](https://neetcode.io/practice); then continues with [grind169 (sorted by topic, then difficulty)](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40&mode=all&grouping=topics&order=difficulty); then 'leetcode top interview 150'
[^unfinished]: check [todo](../todo.md), some listings below are pretty rough. i try not to list it here until it's decent enough

# Style
- code
	- make it easy to not just READ, but UNDERSTAND what it is doing
		- i'll probably remember it better if i understand the code too
	- it's fine to have 'longer code' for these problems: the solutions are so short, that a 'long solution' isn't even that long
	- this generally means, avoid:
		- oneliners
		- code that doesn't match up with the intuition/explanation


# References
- most stuff here isn't original
- Leetcode
	- youtube
		- neetcode
			- he doesnt give all 'good to know solutions', but he always explains the 'best' solution very well. so imo, these are probably the best starting point for completely understanding the problem and solutions
			- this is reason why i'm starting with neetcode150 list instead of grind169; ie if i cant understand it, then i know i can fall back here; or if i'm too tired that i dont even want to read, then i can at minimum watch the youtube solution 
		- https://www.youtube.com/@cheatcodeninja/videos
	- github
		- https://github.com/lzl124631x/LeetCode/tree/master/leetcode
			- this guy seems to have writeups for the harder problems
	- https://leetcodethehardway.com/
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/271
		- replace 271 with whatever number the problem is
		- these sometimes/often don't actually have the best solution
	- leetcode forum users
		- https://leetcode.com/hiepit/
			- this guy consistently seems the best. covers all the necessary approaches, extremely concise, gives the key idea with proper terminology. some of the other guys below are more comprehensive but too rambly, and/or provide extra approaches that don't seem 'necessary' to know/cover

			- this guy seems famous, but actually i'm generally not a fan, he's addicted to writing unreadable code bc he just slaps way too many operators, language specific things/tricks into it in order to cut down the number of lines, that don't seem to actually make the code any more efficient
			- basically he's inadvertently singlehandedly convincing me that oneliners are terrible, and i shouldnt use too many esoteric functions or going inception style and nesting dozens of generators/comprehensions
				- just stick to popular functions; when the solutions are already this short, there's nothing wrong with loops and multiline conditional statements, bc everyone knows what you're doing and it's way easier to read, even if you're familiar with oneliner if/else assignments
				- even if you're aware of how increment operators behave (ie ocurring before or after assignment); it's just completely unecessary brainpower to use when you're trying to read a solution; or keeping track of all the generators that are nested inside each other; its just far easier to read when it's just indented
			- ie completely missing the point...point of leetcode is to understand the patterns and major techniques of how to work with structures...not to write oneliners lol

	- when i go thorugh grind169..tbh i should order it by topic and difficulty (like neetcode does); not by the og ordering
		- the og ordering (where they mix it up) is more meant if i'm practicing leetcode their way, ie actually going through and solving them without looking up solutions..completely different from what i'm doing, which is just reading and understanding solutions
