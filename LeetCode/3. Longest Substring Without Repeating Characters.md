[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

A **substring** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "abcabcbb"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "bbbbb"`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = "pwwkew"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.  
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.  

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# BRUTE FORCE
- strategy
	- for every substring (count N^2):
		- check if the substring has duplicates (takes constant time) (can use a set to check this)
		- if no duplicates: see if substring is a new max length
- complexity
	- O(N^3) time


# SLIDING WINDOW
- strategy
	- use two pointers to slide through string (corresp to boundaries of current substring)
	- use a data structure to quickly compute what letters are in the window
	- which data structure
		- can use set, dict, or list.
		- dict or list are better, bc lets you also store the (most recent/rightward) index for that letter. aka:
			- keep track of (most recent) index for seen letters
				- when we move the right pointer, the indices let us know if this next letter repeats a letter already in the window
				- if so, adjust left pointer accordingly so that window only contains unique letters again
		- dict is likely best, depending on the constraints
			- if it's just letters, then list is fine, bc its size at most 26
			- but as more chars are allowed, then required list is larger
			- dict is also easier to code imo; dont have to 'estimate' the number of possible chars to encounter, aka what size array you need
		- set only stores the letters currently in the window; so if you encounter a repeated letter, then you need to iteratively pop letters from the set as you move the left pointer
			- versus dict/list: can immediately jump the left pointer to the previous index of the repeated letter
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space (to store indices of seen characters; at most...128 possible chars?)


## set

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```

## list
- observe: initialize list with a negative value..ie not 0, bc that's actually a valid index
	- -1 or -inf or whatever
- the constraints say that the chars dont have to be letters, so the array cant just be size 26
