[297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# ser = Codec()
# deser = Codec()
# ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root))
```

# Description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227114908.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `root = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.  
The input `[1,null,2,3]` represents the _serialized_ format of a binary tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

**Examples:**  
`[1,null,2,3]`  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227115257.png)  

`[5,4,7,3,null,2,null,-1,null,9]`

## traversal basics


# Results
## when to use pre-order or level-order
- you can easily do the serialize step using in-order and post-order as well
- !!! however the importance of order occurs during the deserialize step
	- when you want to build the tree: it will be by far easier if you create the parent node before children
	- otherwise, what are you going to connect children to
	- actually yea: in/post would likely be asymptotically worse space efficient:
		- bc you probably need some kind of structure to store all the (references to) nodes
		- ie: you make an initial pass to create all the nodes
		- then you pass again to actually make connections
- thus, easier to use a traversal where the parent is created before children
	- aka pre or level



- also...is there like a 'memory' savings idea going? or at least some kind of efficiency?
	- it seems for post order: you would need to hold both left/right 'info' in memory, and then return it to the parent that called it
	- then parent adds itself to the 'info'
	- so then you have all these calls that are passing these increasing larger info around
	- (and similar issue with in-order)
	- ehh maybe this is nonsense..surely there's a way to get around it? but doesn't seem that obvious to me...
		- cuz it doesn't seem like a node would ever know when it could 'write info to global info'
	- versus pre/level-order: you just immediately add/'write' the node to the 'global info', and then move onto children; ie no need to 'pass around' the 'info'

	
- btw specifically: doesn't this ultimately mean you should use pre-order?
	- iirc bfs is generally worse memory than dfs



## possibly another important thing? TBD

As always, it's not just AC in leetcoding, it's more on practicing coding foundation, re-learning DSA, and pattern recognition, .

Initially, I implemented level order and AC, so I moved on happily.  
However, when I encounter 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees today and BFS on each node, it's so sloooow. Now I know I have to go for another route: recursive.

By understanding [@kevinko1788](https://leetcode.com/kevinko1788)'s post: [preorder implementation](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/discuss/396124/Python-very-easy-to-understand-recursive-preorder-with-comments), I've relearned recursion.

Thank [@GabrielD-](https://leetcode.com/GabrielD-) very much to clarify the extra space cost on new data list instantiation in left/right recursion. The use of deque to pop so as to achieve same goal of remove processed node reminds me Basic Calculator II.

As other post mentioned, to make codec stateless is the more important reason to get away from global/object var. Anyway, both implementation are good for practicing recursion.  
Here's my 2 cent refactor based on yours and [@chiwu1997](https://leetcode.com/chiwu1997) 's deque implement for study.

```python
def deserialize(self, data):
        def dfs(q) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
            v = q.popleft()
            if v == 'x':
                return None
            root = TreeNode(int(v))
            root.left = dfs(q)
            root.right = dfs(q)
            return root

        q = deque(data.split(','))
        return dfs(q)
```





# Approaches


## traversal
- just include the following:
	- indicator for empty node
	- delimiter

- traversals
	- level-order aka bfs
		- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0200-0299/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree-hard
	- pre-order
		- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/297
	- post-order serialize; pre-order deserialize
		- https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/solutions/4997402/post-order-solution/



```python
# pre-order
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        res = []

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                res.append("N")
                return
            res.append(str(node.val))
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)

        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(res)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        vals = data.split(",")
        self.i = 0

        def dfs():
            if vals[self.i] == "N":
                self.i += 1
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(vals[self.i]))
            self.i += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        return dfs()
