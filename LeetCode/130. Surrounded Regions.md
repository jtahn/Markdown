# Description

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417153324.png)  
**Input:** `board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]`  
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:  
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.  
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `board = [["X"]]`  
**Output:** `[["X"]]`

**Constraints:**
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

# Results

## tbd


- basically try to find general idea behind the 'hint' bc it's key:
	- ie 'O' should not be flipped if it is on the border, or adjacent to something that should not be flipped
	- aka this immediately tells us how to discover all Os that shouldnt be flipped:
		- start with Os on the border
		- then, anything in that component


- so then the strat becomes:
	- first figure out all the Os we shouldnt flip
		- aka traverse unsurrounded components
	- then we know rest of the Os can be flipped
		- dont even need to traverse
		- just iterate through the board and flip O's
	- then undo the temp letter change


## tbd
- basically the basic idea of the technique is:
	- problem
		- you want to change some of the X into Y
	- solution
		- identify which X you dont want to change
			- change these to Z
		- now change rest of the X into Y
		- change Z into X
