[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141221.png)  
**Input:** 
```
grid = [
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
]
```
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]`  
**Output:** `0`  

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

- strategy
	- #/jargon/traversal 'plan to' explore each connected component
	- #graphs/traversal/compute_value
		- use traversal to compute/return a value
		- i have some tree problems that do this
			- tree is subclass of graph, so maybe those problems just use this tag too
	- optimization: #array/traversal/storing_visited_nodes_in_place 
		- could modify matrix values to have 'negative numbers' or 0 after you visit them






# References

## graph traversal on connected components
- see
	- [200. Number of Islands](200.%20Number%20of%20Islands.md)
- traversals are performed/initiated in the exact same manner
	- ie initiate only on new connected components


# Results
## computing stuff with graph traversals
- compare with [200. Number of Islands](200.%20Number%20of%20Islands.md)
	- we incremented 'num islands' when a traversal was initiated
- versus here:
	- nothing special happens on initiation
	- however, the actual traversal now computes a value (the area)
		- because: when the traversal completes/returns, we will use the value to update a 'global' quantity (aka curr max area)



# Strategies

- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0600-0699/max-area-of-island-medium
	- approach one uses 'trick': modify grid instead of needing a 'collision' set
	- so does https://algo.monster/liteproblems/695


```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visit = set()

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (
                r < 0
                or r == ROWS
                or c < 0
                or c == COLS
                or grid[r][c] == 0
                or (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return 0
            visit.add((r, c))
            return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)

        area = 0
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area
