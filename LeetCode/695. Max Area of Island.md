[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141221.png)  
**Input:** 
```
grid = [
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
]
```
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]`  
**Output:** `0`  

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

# Approaches

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visit = set()

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (
                r < 0
                or r == ROWS
                or c < 0
                or c == COLS
                or grid[r][c] == 0
                or (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return 0
            visit.add((r, c))
            return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)

        area = 0
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area
