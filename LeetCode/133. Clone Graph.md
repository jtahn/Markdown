# Description

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141642.png)  
**Input:** `adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`  
**Output:** `[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`  
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.  
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141707.png)  
**Input:** `adjList = [[]]`  
**Output:** `[[]]`  
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `adjList = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## graph basics
- connected
- undirected



In an undirected graph G, two vertices u and v are called connected if G contains a path from u to v. Otherwise, they are called disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length 1 (that is, they are the endpoints of a single edge), the vertices are called adjacent.

A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices. 



An undirected graph is just a graph. People specify 'undirected' to distinguish it from a directed graph.

A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.


# Results
## jargon: deep copy

Shallow copy involves creating a new, uninitialized object, B, and copying each field value from the original, A. Due to this procedure, this is also known as a field-by-field copy, field-for-field copy, or field copy. If the field value is a primitive type (such as int), the value is copied such that changes to the value in B do not affect the value in A. If the field value is a reference to an object (e.g., a memory address) the reference is copied, hence referring to the same object that A does. Changing the state of the inner object affects the emergent state of both A and B since the objects are shared.

Deep copy involves copying the state of all subordinate objects – recursively dereferencing object references at each level of the tree that is the state of the original object and creating new objects and copying fields. A modification of either the original or copied object, including their inner objects, does not affect the other since they share no content.



# Approaches

```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: "Node") -> "Node":
        oldToNew = {}

        def dfs(node):
            if node in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node]

            copy = Node(node.val)
            oldToNew[node] = copy
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(nei))
            return copy

        return dfs(node) if node else None

```




- if we've already visited node, then it means
	- we already have made a copy
	- we have a call that will deep copy its stuff (ie the references/etc)
	- so the base case should just be: return the node copy

- otherwise:
	- copy the node
	- copy neighbors via recursive calls on neighbors
