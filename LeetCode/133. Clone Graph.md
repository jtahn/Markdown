```

# Description

Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141642.png)  
**Input:** `adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`  
**Output:** `[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]`  
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.  
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417141707.png)  
**Input:** `adjList = [[]]`  
**Output:** `[[]]`  
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `adjList = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## graph basics
- connected
- undirected



In an undirected graph G, two vertices u and v are called connected if G contains a path from u to v. Otherwise, they are called disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length 1 (that is, they are the endpoints of a single edge), the vertices are called adjacent.

A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices. 



An undirected graph is just a graph. People specify 'undirected' to distinguish it from a directed graph.

A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.

# todo

## to fundy
- a lot of fundies, probly do it like what i'm doing for graph traversals
	- see [200. Number of Islands](200.%20Number%20of%20Islands.md)
	- the simplest example has the 'basic' pseudocde and the 'full summary' pseudocode
		- then have it link to all the possible extensions
- omfg yes!! and then, rewrite all code using the skiena template/jargon
	- i'm actually very certain that all these problems, this is possible
	- and it makes it far easier to understand stuff + make connections without having to explicitly write them out

# Results
## jargon: deep copy

Shallow copy involves creating a new, uninitialized object, B, and copying each field value from the original, A. Due to this procedure, this is also known as a field-by-field copy, field-for-field copy, or field copy. If the field value is a primitive type (such as int), the value is copied such that changes to the value in B do not affect the value in A. If the field value is a reference to an object (e.g., a memory address) the reference is copied, hence referring to the same object that A does. Changing the state of the inner object affects the emergent state of both A and B since the objects are shared.

Deep copy involves copying the state of all subordinate objects – recursively dereferencing object references at each level of the tree that is the state of the original object and creating new objects and copying fields. A modification of either the original or copied object, including their inner objects, does not affect the other since they share no content.


## adjacency list representation of a graph
- this problem, maybe go over it via a C implementation, like skiena does
- this problem is simpler than an actual adjacency list, but it's the same structure


## what process_edge is not

extension of dfs graph traversal template
```
DFS(G, v) 
	state[v] = “discovered” 
	process_vertex(v) 
	for each neighbor y of v
		if state[y] = “undiscovered” then 
			process_edge(v, y)
			DFS(G, y) 
	state[v] = “processed” 
```



- process vertex early
	- copy the vertex
		- need to clone/create the copy before you clone its edges
- process vertex late
	- deep copy the list of neighbors
	- needs to happen after dfs on neighbors
		-  bc if neighbor not discovered, then you need to clone it neighbor before you add a reference to it


- why we don't use process edge
	- it's true you can think of this problem as: we need to 'copy' every edge
	- but this isn't really exact; ie this is just very imprecise language
	- what we're really doing: deep copying, aka copy all references
	- bc undirected graph...then each edge corresp to 2 references
	- so more precisely what we're doing: copy all references for each vertex
	- so really: this 'clone edge' should be thought of as a vertex operation

## process_edge

	- dfs
	- probly bfs as well

```python
# dfs neetcode...should be rewritten to match template
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: "Node") -> "Node":
        discovered = {}

        def dfs(v):
            if v in discovered:
                return discovered[v]

            copy = Node(v.val)
            discovered[v] = copy
            for y in v.neighbors:
	            if y in discovered:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(y))
            return copy

        return dfs(node) if node else None
