[189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
```

# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`  
**Output:** `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`  
**Explanation:**  
```
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[3,99,-1,-100]`  
**Explanation:**  
```
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

**Follow up:**
- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

## #/tbd 
- the optimal solution: feels like both an #algebra thing, and a #polya type tag
	- for polya: i want to be something like: ‘interpret operations in other ways’
		- tho note: this requires knowing the ‘other ways to interpret the operation’…aka the ‘abstract math trick’
	- for ‘algebra’: idk, but im just getting this kind of vibe from the trick
	- btw #/meta, i want #algebra to refer to abstract algebra
- the idea/trick is:
	- a ‘rotation’ can be considered equivalent to sequence of ‘reversals on subarrays’
	- importantly:
		- you only need like 3 reversals for any amt of rotation
			- all that changes is which subarrays you act on
		- ‘reversal’ is an O(n) operation, bc all you do is swap things on opposite ends
		- so if you have to rotate more than 3 steps…then this is better than the naive approach of chaining ‘1 step rotations’
	- intuition + showing why this feels like ‘abstract algebra’:
		- this problem says:
			- we start with AB
			- we want BA
		- observe that reversing satisfies same property as transpose:
			- $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$
			- so you basically chain 3 ’transposes’ together
			- ’transposing’ the entire array, gets the B and A in the right place, but ‘flipped’
			- so now you ‘transpose’ the subarrays
			- (alternatively: ‘transpose’ the subarrays first, then transpose the entire thing)


# Strategies


## rotateArray(k) = rotateArray(1) x k
- naive solution



## rotateArray x k = reverseSubarray x 3

		- reverse first n-k
		- reverse last k
		- reverse entire
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/189
		- reverse entire
		- reverse first k
		- reverse last n-k
