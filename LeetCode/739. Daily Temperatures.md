[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

```
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
```

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is the number of days you have to wait after the_ `ith` _day to get a warmer temperature_. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`  
**Output:** `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`  
**Output:** `[1,1,1,0]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `temperatures = [30,60,90]`  
**Output:** `[1,1,0]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

# Brute force
- strategy
	- for each day
		- iterate through rest of the days until we hit warmer
- complexity
	- O(n^2)



# MAJOR OBSERVATION
- there is a crucial observation here:
	- the fact that there is a bounded and discrete temp range, and the problem specifies "warmer temperature" instead of "same or warmer", means that the direction of iteration actually matters
	- the direction you iterate:
		- changes what the stack/hash needs to hold
			- equivalently, changes the inequality that decides what needs to be held
		- means that iterating backwards is O(1) space, but iterating forwards is O(n) space
- ultimately means that best overall approach is:
	- monotonic stack with reverse iteration


notes from hashing approach, that should be rephrased bc they work for stacks as well:
- warning: this approach is not equivalent complexity if you iterate forwards
	- like monotonic stack solution: you can modify this approach to iterate forwards; but it has worse space complexity...aka just use the monotonic stack solution, bc this one has a much worse constant for the time complexity
		- if you iterate forwards, this means that `mostRecent` needs to store/update colder temps (instead of warmer)
		- so the idea being, for each temp, you would iterate through strictly lower temps, and update all indices you find with the answer
			- the problem is that 'same' temp is not considered lower
			- so if you hav string of same temps i, then `mostRecent[i]` keeps getting values appended to it.
		- ie issue here is that: mostRecent[i] must allow multiple entries, ie `mostRecent` is now a list of lists
		- so this has high space complexity
		- aka its very that we say warmer; if we allowed "or say temp", then this reverse direction would have O(1) space complexity as well
		- time complexity is O(n) still (bc for each day, you iterate over constant number of temps; and the 'update answer' is amortized O(n))
			- but the constant is much worse than stacks, so you should just use stacks 
	- aka the key observation here is that:
		- "warmer" means that iterating backwards is strictly better
			- is strict equality
		- "warmer or same temp" would allow iterating forwards to be just as good
			- because 'temps that require an update' is unique
			- wait...see the big observation below!!
			- ohhh maybe this is the key!!:
- major observation
	- (go check this aligns with monotonic stack approaches)
	- forwards iteration implies that the stuff you will store is:
		- "temps with indices that require an update"
	- backwards iteration implies that the stuff you will store is:
		- "most recent indices for temps"
	- so it actually matters a lot (for hashing; and possibly stack approach) that the problem says "warmer temperature", instead of "same or warmer temperature"
		- because:
			- for both, backwards always have a unique stored index for each stored temp
			- but for "warmer": forwards does not have a unique index for each temp

- why the direction of iteration implies what you have to store
	- the info you store
		- needs to provide something that future iterations can use
		- based on direction of iteration:
			- what do future iterations have access to?
			- what can they do with that info?
		- if you go backwards:
			- note you only see temps on future days
			- so you just want to know when the warmer temps most recently occurred
		- if you go forwards
			- you only see temps on previous days
			- so want to know to know if you have to update previous
	- oh the key is, what can you actually update, based on direction of iteration
		- if you go forwards:
			- you can't compute answer for current or future days, bc you havent seen any future temps
			- so you need to compute answer for previous days (if possible)
		- if you go backwards:
			- you can't compute answer for previous days, bc you havent seen those temps
			- you can't compute answer for future days, bc the info from today is useless for that
			- so you need to compute answer for current day (if possible)
		- (this is obvious)
		- so then you need to think: what info can i store, will be useful for the possible computations
			- and that is actually the stuff i said earlier
- key observations above!! i think i need to move this to the top








# Hashing/indexing

```
todo: similar to below code, but in place
aka dont need answer array; can just modify temperatures in place


```
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240309124251.png)

very similar approach:
essentially instead of figuring out 'min index' for each node;
you move this computation earlier:
ie the node's index, this is now the min index for every temp AND lower temps
ie `mostRecent` should now store: index when this temp or higher was last seen
it's a very similar approach. same thing imo
also this guy does it in place, like i suspected was possible 
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240309130952.png)



- observation
	- imo the 'hashing' approach has some kind of fundamental observation that makes it different from stacks; ie the idea of like 'flipping' the problem somehow...bc thats what hashing kind of does...
- strategy
	- a `mostRecent` array that stores "most recent encountered indices" of temps; explained below
	- iterate backwards
		- replace indices in the `mostRecent` array as you encounter them
			- so if you replace, you're replacing with a smaller (aka more recent) index, for days you will iterate over later (which are actually, days in the past)
		- once you find index for next warmest day (might not exist):
			- replace the entry in `temperatures` with that index
			- also remember to update mostRecent with the temp that was there (and the index)
				- ie do `mostRecent = temperatures[i]` before you do `temperatures[i] = mostRecent[j]` for `j = min(mostRecent[k:])`
					- where `k = temperatures[i]`
			- because you don't need the temp for that day anymore
				- previous days only care about the most recent index that a temp has occurred; this is now stored in `mostRecent`
- strategy
	- iterate backwards through the array
	- array keeps track of the earliest day seen so far, that a temp has occurred
	- you update this as you iterate
	- earliest day bc:
		- you're iterating backwards
		- when u reach a temp, to see if a warmer temp has happened:
			- you check that array for all the warmer temps
				- and you know, if an index is there, it's the most recent index for that temp (after the current day)
					- no index = sentinel index, ie max.inf
				- and you pick the min out of all these indices (bc you just want any of the warmer temps)
					- aka note: need to check ALL of the warmer temps
- complexity
	- time
		- the constant is much worse than stacks
			- would technically still be O(n), but the constant in the worst case is certainly much larger than the monotonic stack method
			- ie rn we have 70 possible temps, so this is like O(70n)
			- versus i think monotonic stacks, its more like O(2n)
		- the constant is exactly the number of possible temps
			- means this approach only reasonable bc finite temps
			- for a more general problem (ie the 'next greater element'), this type of approach is asymptotically worse (not just 'worse constant')
	- space
		- O(1) if you iterate backwards
			- constant space for `mostRecent` array
		- O(n) if you iterate forwards; see MAJOR OBSERVATION at top of doc

- summary
	- push the index of the current temperature to the stack if it cannot find a higher temperature immediately. Subsequently, with each new day's temperature, we compare it against the peak temperatures on the stack until we find one that is lower or until the stack is empty
	-  a monotonic stack in which, instead of storing the values, we store indices and ensure that the temperatures related to these indices are in ascending order. A monotonic stack is helpful when dealing with problems where we need to know the next greater or smaller element in an array.
	- Store currently unsolved elements, later if there is a bigger number, withdraw the unsolved elements and get the answer.
- observation
	- The intuition behind the solution is to use a stack that helps to track the temperatures and indexes. We traverse the temperatures from left to right, and for each day's temperature, we check whether it is higher than the temperature at the indexes recorded on the stack. If so, this means we have found a day with a warmer temperature for the days corresponding to those indexes. Therefore, for each such index, j, we can update answer[j] to the current day's index minus j, indicating the number of days that had to be waited.
	- The stack keeps track of indexes with temperatures that we haven't yet found a warmer day for. This is an effective approach because the temperatures are processed in order and the stack ensures we only compare temperatures where the future warmer temperature hasn't been found yet. When a warmer temperature is encountered, it is the immediate next warmer temperature for all temperatures currently in the stack. Once updated, we no longer need to consider those days because their next warmer temperature has been determined.
	- In cases where there are no warmer temperatures in the future, the answer will remain 0 by default, as established at the start of the solution.
- strategy
	- monotonic decreasing stack
		- so if any incoming value is larger, we must pop values off the top of the stack, until it satisfies rules 1 or 2 before we can add it to our stack.
	- Create an empty stack `stk` that will store indices of the temperatures array.
	- While there are indices on the stack and the current temperature `t` is greater than the temperature at the top index of the stack (i.e., `temperatures[stk[-1]] < t`), pop the index `j` from the top of the stack. This indicates that we have found a warmer day for the day at index `j`.
	- Calculate the number of days waited for index `j` by subtracting `j` from the current index `i` (i.e., `ans[j] = i - j`). This gives us the number of days that had to pass to reach a warmer temperature.
	- Continue popping from the stack and updating the `ans` array until the stack is empty or a day with a lower temperature is found.
	- If the current day's temperature isn't higher than the temperature at the top index of the stack, or if the stack is empty, push the current index `i` onto the stack. This signifies that we are still looking for a future warmer temperature for this day.
	- Once we exit the loop, we have filled out the `ans` array with the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature after each day. In cases where we do not find a warmer temperature, the default value of `0` remains.
- complexity
	- O(n) time amortized
		- each element is processed as it's pushed into the stack stk and then processed again when it's popped from the stack. Each element can be pushed and popped at most once 
	- O(n) space
		- auxiliary stack `stk` that, in the worst case, might contain all temperature indices (N) at some point in time
		- Additionally, we have an array ans to store the answer for each day, which also contains N elements.
- note
	- your stack can store just the index; bc you can always look up the temp
		- or can store (temp, index)
		- either work

## backwards
- idea:
	- stack only holds days/temps that could be possible answers for previous days
		- so once we know that a day cannot be an answer anymore (aka: bc a previous day has a same or higher temp), then there's no use keeping it: so we just discard it from stack
- complexity
	- same as forwards
	- wait No!!!
		- time is same, but:
		- space is lower!! for same reason in hashing
		- bc the inequality is different
			- in forwards: we only pop if strict equality
			- in backwards, we pop if non strict
			- this is CRUCIAL: because:
				- because the range of temps is constant, this means there can only be at most a constant number of items in the stack
				- kinda like a pigeonhole argument


---

(below: replace deque with stack)
1. Initialize a deque to store indices of temperatures.
2. Initialize a result vector to store the days until a warmer temperature is encountered.
3. Iterate through the temperatures in reverse order.
4. If the deque is empty, push the current index and set the result for that index to 0.
5. If the deque is not empty, pop indices from the front of the deque while the current temperature is greater than or equal to the temperature at the front.
6. If the deque is empty after the above step, set the result for the current index to 0.
7. If the deque is not empty, set the result for the current index to the difference between the front of the deque and the current index.
8. Push the current index to the front of the deque.
9. Continue these steps for all temperatures.
10. Return the result vector.

---

The solution is based on the simple logic that if you start from the right

1. You can keep track of the numbers seen so that when you move left -> That left element already knows which is the maximum number it will encounter
2. If the current number is smaller than the previously seen number -> Simply get the diff in the positions and insert into the stack
3. If the number is greater than the previously seen in stack -> Keep removing all the numbers (Since we need to find the number larger than it. IF found then great if not then it has result 0).

One great reason you can just remove the smaller numbers from stack(seen in right) is that now that we have current number larger than its right elements -> Hence for the lefter elements THIS CURRENT element will itself be the nearest largest number


We don't even need to maintain the element value, we can do without that also by only maintaining it's index.

---


1. Now, our main objective is to keep the candidate temperatures on the stack that can be a next greater temperature for current index. (It will become more clear when you'll read more below).
    
2. Now, for a current temperature at index `i`, we will see the top of the stack and check whether it is greater than current element or not. **Why we do this?** Because stack is a LIFO and we came from right, so the top of the stack will be the latest element/temperature, that would have been pushed into the stack from the right of current index `i` so here can be **two cases:**
    
    - **Case 1:** When this temperature at top of stack is less than the current temperature, then this can never be a next greater element of current temperature or all the other temperatures before current temperature. **Why?** Because for temperatures before current temperature (at position < `i`), temperature at current index can be their candidate for the next greater element. Hence we will simply pop the top of the stack out until we find an element greater than the current index or until the stack gets empty (This, means no greater element on the right).
        
    - **Case 2:** When this temperature at top of the stack is greater than the current then we will simply consider this element as our next greater element and set the distance between the current temperature and next greater element/temperature as our answer for current index.
        
3. After all this is done, then we will have either 0 or the distance between the current temp and next greater temp in the answer vector. Then we will simply push our current element into the stack as now this temp can be a candidate to become the next greater element for the temperatures before this temperature. And then move to the left (iteration goes on like this)

- equivalent: can iterate backwards; you just flip all the inequalities
	- ....this is really unintuitive imo...idk if it's worth having this...
	- why does it feel unintuitive? imo figure this out
	- imo it feeling this unintuitive means that its exactly not the right intuition here

## equivalent interpretation: "jumping through array"
```
vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
    vector<int> res(temperatures.size());
    for (int i = temperatures.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int j = i+1;
        while (j < temperatures.size() && temperatures[j] <= temperatures[i]) {
            if (res[j] > 0) j = res[j] + j;
            else j = temperatures.size();
        }
        // either j == size || temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]
        if (j < temperatures.size()) res[i] = j - i;
    }
    return res;
}
```
- note:
	- backwards direction, "jumping through the computed answers array" is an equivalent interpretation of the stacks solution
		- and surely there's equivalent for forwards
	- why its equivalent
		- ie point of stacks is that we just discard stuff that we know wont themselves be answers
		- vs here: 'discarding' is done via 'jumping past answers'
		- point is that: if we had to jump around on this node, well now when we do computations for previous day: we dont have to jump around, bc today we already did those computations
