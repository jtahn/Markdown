# Description

A **triplet** is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array `triplets`, where `triplets[i] = [a_i, b_i, c_i]` describes the `i^th` **triplet**. You are also given an integer array `target = [x, y, z]` that describes the **triplet** you want to obtain.

To obtain `target`, you may apply the following operation on `triplets` **any number** of times (possibly **zero**):

- Choose two indices (**0-indexed**) `i` and `j` (`i != j`) and **update** `triplets[j]` to become `[max(a_i, a_j), max(b_i, b_j), max(c_i, c_j)]`.
    - For example, if `triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3]` and `triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5]`, `triplets[j]` will be updated to `[max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5]`.

Return `true` _if it is possible to obtain the_ `target` _**triplet**_ `[x, y, z]` _as an **element** of_ `triplets`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** Perform the following operations:
```
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]].
	- Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5].
	- triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** It is impossible to have `[3,2,5]` as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** Perform the following operations:  
```
- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]].
	- Update the third triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5].
	- triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].
- Choose the third and fourth triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].
	- Update the fourth triplet to be [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(5,3)] = [5,5,5].
	- triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,5,5]].
The target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5`
- `triplets[i].length == target.length == 3`
- `1 <= a_i, b_i, c_i, x, y, z <= 1000`

	- idea
		- the only triplets that are useful to us are those that satisfy
			- `[a,b,c] <= [x,y,z]`
				- ie each entry is `<=` the corresp entry in `target`
			- bc if there is an entry `>`, then when you merge, it results in a larger value in the corresp index of `target`
		- then: among triplets that satisfy `<=`:
			- possible IFF for each index, there is a triplet that contains matching entry to target
	- again, this doesn't seem like 'greedy'
		- seems like 'math/proof'; or rather, 'find equivalent characterization/condition for solution'
- everyone is calling this greedy

	- i just don't see how the core idea here is 'greedy'. 
		- i can kinda see how they interpret it like this, but imo it's not natural
		- it's more natural to think of this like 'math' imo
		- like: it's true you can apply the operator 'greedily'...but the important thing is WHY you are allowed to do this
			- and it's this "WHY" that is central to the strategy; not the fact that you can be 'greedy'
- imo the key idea/observation is that:
	- merge operation being sequentially applied to two inputs..its kind of a red herring
		- ie: doesn't actually matter what order you apply it
		- ie: kinda like an associative operation
		- the 'sequence' of inputs can't be 'disjoint' either...
		- i just lack so much jargon here to explain what i'm thinking...
	- and also..even though it's a 'binary' operation..it easily generalizes to a well-defined operation on arbitrary number of elements, that is equivalent to applying binary op in any order
		- actually this is probly exactly equivalent to saying the op is 'associative'
	 - i think this probably boils down to understand properties of operators like 'max' and 'min', bc they have a similar structure
		 - what is the name for these type of operators?
	 - and then this problem boils down to:
		 - is there a subset of input where `operator(subset) = target`
	- actually/similarly...the merge operator is just literally the max operator along 3 dims
		- what is the name of this btw? when you apply operator like this
	- lots of #/jargon above that i need to figure out
	- 



#/fundy #/jargon 
- what is the name for questions where it's just true or false?
	- is it just a 'boolean' problem?
	- i wonder if there's a general fact that these types of problems:
		- there's always an O(n) time strategy that uses O(1) space?
			- basically, figure out some kind of equivalence
			- ie true IFF (some condition), where the the latter is very efficient to check
			- and also seems often: this condition comes via the following 2 step/level process:
				- (ie this problem; but i remember other problems had this too)
				- first: there's a condition/check where you skip invalid/useless elements
				- second: then if the element is 'valid': then you have some kind of quantity/variable you track/update as you iterate
