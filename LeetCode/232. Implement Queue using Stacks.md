[232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

```
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        

    def pop(self) -> int:
        

    def peek(self) -> int:
        

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```

# Description
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**
- You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
```
**Output**  
```
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
```
**Explanation**  
```
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

# todo
## to blurb
- can be worth keeping around alternative intuitions, if they seem reasonable enough, and dont really match my chosen inspo
	- like often times: one of the intuitions is: "this other method is doing a lot of redundant work; how do we prevent it"
	- ie here


# References

## queue basics
- (meta) this problem shouldnt be fundy for queue; bc never actually implement it

## stack basics



# Results

## assign structures to operations, rather than elements
- assigning structures to push and pop (ie input and output)
- if i had to generalize the ‘idea’: maybe:
	- ‘instead of thinking about how you ‘assign’ structures to elements (ie structures hold X type of elements); think about how to assign structures to operations





# Implementations
## one stack holds all elements
- implementations
	- ‘push elements to bottom of stack’
	- ‘pop elements from bottom of stack’

```

- idea
	- ie at the end of every op, one stack holds all elements
	- 2 std ways to achieve this:
		- you decide whether the ‘main logic/routine’ goes into the push or pop operation (current code example focuses on push)



- detailed explanation for implementing 'push elements to bottom'
	- let our two stacks be `s1` and `s2`
		- s1 will be the 'queue'
			- i.e. emulate; "look like" the queue
		- s2 will the aux stack
	- queue is FIFO
		- so new elements get added to end of the queue
	- stack is LIFO
		- so new elements get added to top of the stack
	- goal
		- insert new elements at the bottom of `s1`
		- so that popping from `s1` is same as popping from a queue
- strategy
	- push(element)
		- move s1 onto s2
			- pop everything out of s1 and push onto s2
		- push new element onto either stack
		- move s2 into s1
			- pop everything out of s2 and push onto s1
- time complexity
	- push O(n)
		- every element except the newly arrived is moved 4 times (pushed and popped twice)
		- so 4n+2 operations
	- pop O(1)  





## a push stack and a pop stack
```
class MyQueue:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.input = []
		self.output = []

	def push(self, x: int) -> None:		# enqueue
        self.input.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:               # dequeue
        if not self.output:				# If the output list is empty
			while self.input:			# While the input list is not empty
			    self.output.append(self.input.pop())
        return self.output.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.output:
            while self.input:
                self.output.append(self.input.pop())
        return self.output[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not (self.input or self.output)
```

- idea
	- an 'input' stack and an 'output' stack
	- transferring btwn stacks only happens when necessary (queue peek/pop), i.e. the output stack is empty
		- this transfer puts stuff in the correct order for the queue output ops
- strategy
	- push
		- push into input stack
	- pop
		- if output stack is empty
			- (then input stack has all current elements in LIFO order)
			- transfer routine: transfer input into output
				- pop all element from input, push into output
			- (now all current elements are in FIFO order in the output stack)
			- pop from output
		- if output stack is nonempty
			- pop from output
			- why
				- all elements in output stack were inserted before elements in input stack
				- so we know the element to pop is in output stack
				- recall output stack is in FIFO order already (because of the transfer routine)
				- so we just pop from top
- time complexity
	- push: O(1)
		- just pushes an element onto the input array; this operation does not depend on the lengths of either input or output and therefore runs in constant time
	- pop: amortized O(1)
		- Amortized analysis
			- requires knowledge of which series of operations are possible. This is most commonly the case with data structures, which have state that persists between operations. The basic idea is that a worst-case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time, thus "amortizing" its cost.
			- To perform amortized analysis here, we use the aggregate method
			- Aggregate analysis determines the upper bound T(n) on the total cost of a sequence of n operations, then calculates the amortized cost to be $T(n)/n$
		- If the output array already has some elements in it, then pop runs in constant time
		- otherwise, pop takes $O(n)$ time to add all the elements onto the output array from the input array, where n is the current length of the input array. After copying n elements from input, we can perform n pop operations, each taking constant time, before the output array is empty again. Thus, we can perform a sequence of n dequeue operations in only $O(n)$ time, which implies that the amortized time of each dequeue operation is $O(1)$.
