[232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**
- You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
```
**Output**  
```
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
```
**Explanation**  
```
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

# 'one stack emulates/looks like a queue'
- idea	
	- let our two stacks be `s1` and `s2`
		- s1 will be the 'queue'
		- s2 will the aux stack
	- queue is FIFO
		- so new elements get added to end of the queue
	- stack is LIFO
		- so new elements get added to top of the stack
	- goal
		- insert new elements at the bottom of `s1`
		- so that popping from `s1` is same as popping from a queue
- strategy
	- push(element)
		- move s1 onto s2
			- pop everything out of s1 and push onto s2
		- push new element onto either stack
		- move s2 into s1
			- pop everything out of s2 and push onto s1
- time complexity
	- push O(n)
		- every element except the newly arrived is moved 4 times (pushed and popped twice)
		- so 4n+2 operations
	- pop O(1)

# amortized
```
class MyQueue:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.append_stack = []          # input
        self.inverted_stack = []        # output

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.append_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        if not self.inverted_stack:
            while self.append_stack:
                self.inverted_stack.append(self.append_stack.pop())
        return self.inverted_stack.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.inverted_stack:
            while self.append_stack:
                self.inverted_stack.append(self.append_stack.pop())
        return self.inverted_stack[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not (self.append_stack or self.inverted_stack)
```


- idea
	- an 'input' stack and an 'output' stack
	- transferring btwn stacks only happens when necessary (queue peek/pop), i.e. the output stack is empty
		- this transfer puts stuff in the correct order for the queue output ops
- strategy
	- push
		- push into input stack
	- pop
		- if output stack is empty: run transfer routine
			- 
		- if output stack is nonempty:
			- pop
			- we get the correct element (ie desired output of queue pop) because of the transfer routine
- time complexity
	- push: O(1)
	- pop: amortized O(1)
		- each element only gets transferred once from 'input' to 'output'
			- ie each element only has 4 operations done to it during the entire life of the queue
				- push to input
				- pop from input
				- push to output
				- pop from output
			- the 'transfer routine' can only be triggered during queue peek/pop
			- so queue push cost is O(1)
				- and queue pop cost is amortized O(1)

(todo: rewrite python code / use variables so it looks more readable;
the java/cpp is more readable than current python code lol)
