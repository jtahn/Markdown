[232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**
- You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
```
**Output**  
```
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
```
**Explanation**  
```
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

# worse: "queue and aux"

- idea	
	- let our two stacks be `s1` and `s2`
		- s1 will be the 'queue'
			- i.e. emulate; "look like" the queue
		- s2 will the aux stack
	- queue is FIFO
		- so new elements get added to end of the queue
	- stack is LIFO
		- so new elements get added to top of the stack
	- goal
		- insert new elements at the bottom of `s1`
		- so that popping from `s1` is same as popping from a queue
- strategy
	- push(element)
		- move s1 onto s2
			- pop everything out of s1 and push onto s2
		- push new element onto either stack
		- move s2 into s1
			- pop everything out of s2 and push onto s1
- time complexity
	- push O(n)
		- every element except the newly arrived is moved 4 times (pushed and popped twice)
		- so 4n+2 operations
	- pop O(1)  





# better: "input and output"
```
class MyQueue:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.input = []
		self.output = []

	def push(self, x: int) -> None:		# enqueue
        self.input.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:               # dequeue
        if not self.output:				# If the output list is empty
			while self.input:			# While the input list is not empty
			    self.output.append(self.input.pop())
        return self.output.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.output:
            while self.input:
                self.output.append(self.input.pop())
        return self.output[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not (self.input or self.output)
```

- idea
	- an 'input' stack and an 'output' stack
	- transferring btwn stacks only happens when necessary (queue peek/pop), i.e. the output stack is empty
		- this transfer puts stuff in the correct order for the queue output ops
- strategy
	- push
		- push into input stack
	- pop
		- if output stack is empty
			- (then input stack has all current elements in LIFO order)
			- transfer routine: transfer input into output
				- pop all element from input, push into output
			- (now all current elements are in FIFO order in the output stack)
			- pop from output
		- if output stack is nonempty
			- pop from output
			- why
				- all elements in output stack were inserted before elements in input stack
				- so we know the element to pop is in output stack
				- recall output stack is in FIFO order already (because of the transfer routine)
				- so we just pop from top
- time complexity
	- push: O(1)
		- just pushes an element onto the input array; this operation does not depend on the lengths of either input or output and therefore runs in constant time
	- pop: amortized O(1)
		- Amortized analysis
			- requires knowledge of which series of operations are possible. This is most commonly the case with data structures, which have state that persists between operations. The basic idea is that a worst-case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time, thus "amortizing" its cost.
			- To perform amortized analysis here, we use the aggregate method
			- Aggregate analysis determines the upper bound T(n) on the total cost of a sequence of n operations, then calculates the amortized cost to be $T(n)/n$
		- If the output array already has some elements in it, then pop runs in constant time
		- otherwise, pop takes $O(n)$ time to add all the elements onto the output array from the input array, where n is the current length of the input array. After copying n elements from input, we can perform n pop operations, each taking constant time, before the output array is empty again. Thus, we can perform a sequence of n dequeue operations in only $O(n)$ time, which implies that the amortized time of each dequeue operation is $O(1)$.

## alternative
- (todo: maybe this should be the actual technique i describe)
	- seems easier to understand connection between this and the worse "queue and aux" method
		- the difference is: worse method, same stack used for initial input and final output
		- but the better method: one stack purely for initial input; other stack purely for output
	- however still understand why ppl prefer the other way to do "input and output"
		- only diff btwn this technique and the other input/output technique: either transfer every input; or transfer on output as needed
			- like the latter is more efficient/slightly faster in practice
			- but they're identical complexity asymptotically
- strategy
	- push
		- push into input, immediately transfer to output
		- so output always looks like the full 'queue'
- complexity
	- Alternatively, we can charge the cost of copying any item from the input array to the output array to the earlier enqueue operation for that item. This charging scheme doubles the amortized time for enqueue but reduces the amortized time for dequeue to $O(1)$.
