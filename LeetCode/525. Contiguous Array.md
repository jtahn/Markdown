[525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of_ `0` _and_ `1`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,1]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** `[0, 1]` is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** `[0, 1]` (or `[1, 0]`) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

# Strategies


## tbd (probly: greedy)
 - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/525
	 - same solution
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=agB1LyObUNE
	- uses hashmap and jargon ‘prefix’
	- imo, ‘prefix’ doesn’t feel like the correct inspo/jargon here
- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0500-0599/contiguous-array-medium#approach-1-prefix-sum--hash-map
	- nvm, this is more convincing why ‘prefix’ might be correct jargon
		- we basically iterate through array and compute prefix sums
		- and the hashmap determines what we do with the sum:
			- if sum not in hashmap: add it
			- if sum in hashmap: update max
	- ehh ultimately tho..imo prefix just seems too ‘overpowered’ to use here
		- the real key here are the ‘differences’ of subarrays
		- well wait…do ppl always call it ‘prefix’ when they iterate over increasing subarrays starting at the left?
			- actually would make sense if they do, seems like a very convenient jargon to use, instead of always saying ‘subarrays with left endpoint at 0’

- idea/strat:
	- iterate through array and compute the ‘difference in counts’ at each index
	- then observe:
		- indices with same ‘difference count’ define a ‘valid’ subarray
		- and so now, we just want to find the longest ‘valid’ subarray
		- can use hashmap:
			- key:value will be difference:index
			- as we iterate through array:
				- if key doesnt exist
					- ie first time we’ve seen that difference
					- then add the keyval
				- if key exists:
					- then this is right endpt of a valid subarray
					- use keyval to determine earliest left endpt
					- so now we know length of this valid subarray
					- if this is new max length, then update
		- and actually: can do the ‘compute diffs’ and ‘construct/use hashmap’ all in one pass
			- at each index, compute diff
			- if diff not in hashmap: then make keyval
			- if diff in hashmap: then do the subroutine above: compute length, update max
- anyways..this feels like a #greedy approach
	- bc the ‘first time’ we see a sum is always the ‘left endpoint’
