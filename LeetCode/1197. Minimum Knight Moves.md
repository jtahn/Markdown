[1197. Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves)

```python
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
	    
```

# Description

In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return _the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square_ `[x, y]`. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `x = 2, y = 1`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** `[0, 0] → [2, 1]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `x = 5, y = 5`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** `[0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]`  

**Constraints:**
- `-300 <= x, y <= 300`
- `0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300`

#/workflow 
- tbh i think the best way to add lc writeups is:
	- find the best chinese repos, and just use those as the primary resource
		- via a good translator (look into AI)
		- likely wont need any other writeups
		- use them to make my own markdown writeups
			- aka benefit of my markdown is that i can do all the linking with tags + my own refs

## #complexity/TLE 
- maybe this problem is a good candidate to be aware of 'complexity requirements'
	- be aware of leetcode limits on time/storage
	- and if this problem size is probly way below the limit:
		- then what is 'reasonably small enough' that we're fine with the 'naive bfs' solution?
- space limit?
	- apparently 100mb?
- seems the time limit:
	- If I recall correctly most online judge time is around 1 second that means about 10^8 operations at max
	- Quote from one of the explore cards: "As a rule of thumb, if an approach is expected to require more than 10^8 operations in the worst-case scenario, then it is at risk of receiving time limit exceeded (TLE). "
	- this means something like:

```
     Input                Accepted Time Complexity
1) Around 10                   O(n!)
2) 15 - 25                     O(2 ^ n * n) {read it as 2 to the power n multiply by n}
3) 100                         O(n ^ 4)  {read it as n to the power four}
4) 400.                        O(n ^ 3) {read it as n to the power three}
5) 1000 (10 ^ 3)               O(n ^ 2) {read it as n to the power two}
6) 10 ^ 5 or 10 ^ 6            O(n) and also O(n * log n)
7) 10 ^ 9 or more                      O(log n)
```



## #graphs/traversal/bfs 


- here: essentially standard bfs on a matrix
	- main twist: the 'neighbors' are not the standard n/s/e/w
	- other considieration: how to store visited nodes?
		- bc possible issue: infinite board
		- looking at the constraints: still seems fine/reasonable to just store the visited nodes
		- bc we do know: target is at least within square of side 300
		- so 90k possible positions within the square
		- and can reasonable expect: even if knight needs to move out of the square to reach target...can't be more than say, 100k moves outside the square



## #graphs/traversal/bfs/bidirectional

- [[_refs/01 competitive programming/halim2.pdf#page=143|halim2, 8.2.3 Meet in the Middle]]


- seems very silly to keep adding neighbors shooting off to infinity??
- ohhh this is why bidirectional bfs
- why it's good here:
	- we know exactly which nodes we want a path for
	- every time we go through a queue, we exponentially/branch by 8
	- by starting 2 separate bfs: we basically 'share' the branch load
	- so vaguely, it's like: if the path was distance 10:
		- then instance of queueing `10^8`; we queue like `2 * 5^8`


Bidirectional BFS is a common optimization method for BFS. The main implementation ideas are as follows:

1. Create two queues, q1 and q2, for "start -> end" and "end -> start" search directions, respectively.
2. Create two hash maps, m1 and m2, to record the visited nodes and their corresponding expansion times (steps).
3. During each search, prioritize the queue with fewer elements for search expansion. If a node visited from the other direction is found during the expansion, it means the shortest path has been found.
4. If one of the queues is empty, it means that the search in the current direction cannot continue, indicating that the start and end points are not connected, and there is no need to continue the search.



## #matrix/traversal

- infinite grid, so use a set to store visited


# Strategies


## bfs (compute/store steps)

- strat
	- init bfs at start
	- explore neighbors
		- if target, return
		- if not target: enqueue if valid (aka unvisited)


```python
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
	    queue = deque([(0,0)])
	    moves_count = 0
	    visited = {(0,0)}
		dirs = ((-2,1), (-1,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,-1), (1,-2), (-1,-2), (-2,-1))
		while queue:
			for _ in range(len(queue)):
				r, c = queue.popleft()
				if (r, c) == (x,y):
					return moves_count
				for (dr, dc) in dirs:
					fr, fc = r + dr, c + dc
					if (fr, fc) not in visited:
						visited.add((fr, fc))
						queue.append((fr, fc))
			moves_count += 1
		return -1

```



- complexity
	- time
		- Since the board is infinite, the maximum distance from the origin in terms of the number of moves can be represented by `max(abs(x), abs(y))`. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, we can consider moving diagonally (in L-shaped movements) towards the target, which is roughly `max(abs(x), abs(y))` moves away. However, the actual number of moves requires considering the peculiarities of knight's movements. The BFS will have a branching factor of at most 8 (the possible moves the knight can make), and the depth will be proportional to the distance from the origin to the target.
		- Thus, the time complexity can be approximated as `O(8^(d))` where `d` is the depth of the BFS, or more accurately, `O((max(abs(x), abs(y)))^2)` because each layer of BFS (which corresponds to one knight's move) potentially adds up to 8 new positions in the queue.
	- space
		- the `vis` set
			- same arg as time: `O((max(abs(x), abs(y)))^2)`
		- the `q` queue
			- imo should also be `O((max(abs(x), abs(y)))^2)`
			- basically bc each node we visit, adds another 8 to queue
			- so queue size explodes exponentionally until we hit target

                    q.append((fr, fc))
                    m1[(fr, fc)] = step + 1
            return -1

            return 0
            
        q1, q2 = deque([(0, 0)]), deque([(x, y)])
        m1, m2 = {(0, 0): 0}, {(x, y): 0}
        
        while q1 and q2:
            t = extend(m1, m2, q1) if len(q1) <= len(q2) else extend(m2, m1, q2)
            if t != -1:
                return t
        return -1
