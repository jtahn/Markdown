[179. Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        
```

# Description

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [10,2]`  
**Output:** `"210"`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [3,30,34,5,9]`  
**Output:** `"9534330"`  

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# todo

#/meta 
- what kind/category of problem is this? candidates:
	- ‘math’
	- ‘adhoc’
	- python (bc know how to make custom comparison class)


# Reference

## #interview/clarify
- this seems like one of those questions where you should ask clarification question/examples
	- ie ‘what do you do if all the numbers are 0?’
		- ie if you are given `[0,0,0]`, do i return `0` or `000`?
	- (it seems judging by other solutions, the problem wants you to return `0`)

- #/jargon what do i call this tag?
	- bc it feels more general than ‘clarifications to make during interview’
	- ie seems the real/underlying skill here is, ‘knowing what small cases to think about, so you better understand the desired output’
- #/meta i feel like this type of tag is very important
	- very important skill to develop
		- getting a sense of what kind of small examples / corner cases you need to think about, given the problem
			- and i highly suspect, there’s lots of patterns here
		- also i highly suspect: this overlaps heavily with understanding how to write good unit tests



## #python/modules/functools 
- `cmp_to_key`

## #python/builtins_sort  
- ‘defining and using your own custom comparison’ function
	- in particular, via `functools.cmp_to_key()`


## #python/strings 
- concatenation operator is `+`
- comparison operator btwn strings that are integers:
	- seems it compares as if they are numbers
	- which i suspect means: it is NOT lexicographic comparison
	- this seems important to know, bc i also suspect: for arbitrary strings, the comparison IS lexicographic


- #/research what is the running time of concatenation?
	- bc maybe both practical and asymptotic optimization would be:
		- actually do the comparison via integers


## #/tbd 


- it’s kinda obvious that you need to run some kind of sort
	- but imo, proving correctness of the sort..lowkey kinda subtle?
- what exactly am i even trying to prove?
	- ‘sorting n elements via this comparison operator btwn 2 elements, gives you what you want’

- how do i prove/generalize it cleanly?
	- thm idea (but imo needs to for n elements):
		- if a>b>c
			- aka ab > ba and bc > cb
		- then abc is the biggest thing you can make out of all of these
	- proof
		- probly induction works, but it’s not that obvious tbh
	- what is the ‘abstract math idea’ going on here?
		- maybe transitivity?
		- maybe: check the smallest possible examples
			- if you need to run an operation on many elements: 
				- see if you can figure out operation on just 2 elements, and if it generalizes or chains in an obvious way

# Strategies

## define ‘comparison’ and sort

- examples
	- neetcode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDx6Y4i4xJ8&pp=ygUXbmVldGNvZGUgbGFyZ2VzdCBudW1iZXI%3D
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/179

- strat
	- step 1: figure out the required ‘comparison’ operator btwn 2 elements, such that sorting wrt this operator gives us the correct answer
	- step 2: write the function for this operator
	- step 3: perform sort, where comparisons are made wrt that function
- implementation
	- steps 2 and 3 can be simplified heavily in python:
		- define a comparison function
		- use builtin sort on this comparison function
		- (imo: this should be the default approach; bc otherwise, you probly need to write your own sorting algo from scratch…which i highly suspect is not advised)
- convenience
	- it’s easier to work with strings, bc then we can just ‘concatenate’ them..exactly how the problem wants us to do it
	- aka we will convert numbers to strings
	- it’s most efficient to just do this at the very beginning, instead of inside the comparison operator
