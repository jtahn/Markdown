class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:

```

# Description

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420012147.png)  
**Input:** 
```
board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:**
```
[["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
```
**Explanation:** The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420012205.png)  

**Constraints:**
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution.

#/jargon 
- tag for fundeez/strats that i should be aware of, but absolutely would not be expected to implement in an interview
	- basically to prove that i'm well read
	- and so, don't actually try to understand it
		- just memorize that it applies
- example
	- #aware/dancing_links for [[37. Sudoku Solver]]
- currently: #aware 


#/jargon 
- what do i call 'structure' that is just a 'variable'?
	- and there are various types..i'm looking for multiple jargon here; one should indicate the general concept behind all of these; and then 'sub jargon' for like each type: 
		- 'flag' (aka boolean)
			- aka here
		- 'curr best solution'/or 'curr candidate we're building'
			- sometimes a number, ie 'curr max'
			- sometimes a 'structure' itself (ie best subarray/string so far)
				- but this feels different in flavor than structures that are used to like...'aux structures' for like collisions/counting; or 'main structures' used in the 'main routine' for their 'efficient operations'
			- often something like 'curr max'
		- 'monitoring a specific index or value'
			- ie in [[895. Maximum Frequency Stack]]

#/research 
- at some point, consider looking at these vids?
	- not urgent tho, this solution is pretty straightforward if you understand backtracking fundamentals

## #backtracking 
- (rewrite this under the 'standard backtracking template/jargon'; ie see skiena/etc)
	- for each neighbor/candidate:
		- aka nums 0 through 9
		- if valid:
			- make move
			- recursive dfs call
			- undo move
		- else:
			- try next candidate
	- if exhaust all candidates at this node:
		- go back to prev node
- structures required
	- track collisions among row/col/sub-block
		- aka determine valid candidates at this 'node'
	- initial empty positions
		- which nodes to iterate over
	- 'flag' var to indicate if puzzle is solved
		- so then when the call at the final 'goes back up' to the previous node:
			- this previous node knows that we came back because puzzle was solved
			- aka not because the previous node should try the next candidate


# Strategies



## backtracking
- complexity
	- time O(9^81)
	- space O(9^2)

```python
class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        def dfs(k):
            nonlocal ok
            if k == len(t):
                ok = True
                return
            i, j = t[k]
            for v in range(9):
                if row[i][v] == col[j][v] == block[i // 3][j // 3][v] == False:
                    row[i][v] = col[j][v] = block[i // 3][j // 3][v] = True
                    board[i][j] = str(v + 1)
                    dfs(k + 1)
                    row[i][v] = col[j][v] = block[i // 3][j // 3][v] = False
                if ok:
                    return

        row = [[False] * 9 for _ in range(9)]
        col = [[False] * 9 for _ in range(9)]
        block = [[[False] * 9 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
        t = []
        ok = False
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    t.append((i, j))
                else:
                    v = int(board[i][j]) - 1
                    row[i][v] = col[j][v] = block[i // 3][j // 3][v] = True
        dfs(0)
```




## #aware/dancing_links

- Dr. Donald Knuth’s Dancing Links Algorithm solves an Exact Cover situation. The Exact Cover problem can be extended to a variety of applications that need to fill constraints. Sudoku is one such special case of the Exact Cover problem.
