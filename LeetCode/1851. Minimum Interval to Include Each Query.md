[1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query/)

```python
class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
```

# Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i]` describes the `i^th` interval starting at `left_i` and ending at `right_i` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `right_i - left_i + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `j^th` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `left_i <= queries[j] <= right_i`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array containing the answers to the queries_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[3,3,1,4]`  
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:  
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]`  
**Output:** `[2,-1,4,6]`  
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:  
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= left_i <= right_i <= 10^7`
- `1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7`

#/meta 
- how do i develop the skill/intuition in (quickly) estimating the best possible complexity i can expect to achieve?


# References

## #greedy/sort 
- working with sorted input just makes ‘greedy’ strategies more obvious
- here:
	- bc we essentially have that, wrt sorted queries:
		- the sorted intervals go from invalid to valid, at most once
		- the sorted intervals go from valid to invalid, at most once
	- and this greatly simplifies things


## #priority_queue 
- seems like the standard structure when you basically:
	- want to have a container that contains all valid candidates
		- (note: importantly, you should probably allow it to contain invalid stuff, see below)
	- among valid candidates, we only care about the ‘best’ one
	- set of valid candidates will change over time


- feels like this happens very often: we define heap in such a way that:
	- heap is sorted based on ‘best possible’ wrt whatever criteria we care about, regardless of valid or invalid
	- importantly: heap can contain both valid and invalid
	- point 1: it’s nbd that it contains invalid
		- ie don’t have to waste effort of ‘maintaining only valids in the heap’
			- this would mean: at each iteration, going through heap to remove valids
		- you just take care of this when you peek
	- point 2: we sort according to a key such that: the top of the heap (if valid) is the solution
		- typically, if invalid: then it’s invalid for all future checks
		- so it’s fine to just keep popping until top is valid
		- and once top is valid: this is the solution


# Strategies



## sort inputs + pq intervals

- strategy
	- iterate through sorted queries
		- maintain a pq such that peek returns a query’s answer
		- note: will need to know index associated with each query
			- simplest/‘standard’ way is to probably construct a sorted structure over `(query, index)`
	- priority queue on intervals
		- sorted by size
		- updated via intervals (sorted by start)
			- push interval if it started before the current query
		- pop interval from heap if it ended before current query
		- then top of heap is the answer for this query

- complexity
	- time
		- O(nlogn + mlogm)
	- space O(n+m)
