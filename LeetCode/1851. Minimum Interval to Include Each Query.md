[1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query/)

```python
class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
```

# Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i]` describes the `i^th` interval starting at `left_i` and ending at `right_i` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `right_i - left_i + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `j^th` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `left_i <= queries[j] <= right_i`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array containing the answers to the queries_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[3,3,1,4]`  
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:  
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]`  
**Output:** `[2,-1,4,6]`  
**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:  
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= left_i <= right_i <= 10^7`
- `1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7`

# Approaches


```python
class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intervals.sort()
        minHeap = []
        res = {}
        i = 0
        for q in sorted(queries):
            while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= q:
                l, r = intervals[i]
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (r - l + 1, r))
                i += 1

            while minHeap and minHeap[0][1] < q:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res[q] = minHeap[0][0] if minHeap else -1
        return [res[q] for q in queries]
