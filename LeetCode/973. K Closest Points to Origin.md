[973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

```
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
```

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., $\sqrt{(\texttt{x}_\texttt{1}-\texttt{x}_\texttt{2})^2 + (\texttt{y}_\texttt{1}-\texttt{y}_\texttt{2})^2}$).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224221455.png)  
**Input:** `points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1`  
**Output:** `[[-2,2]]`  
**Explanation:**  
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is `sqrt(10)`.  
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is `sqrt(8)`.  
Since `sqrt(8) < sqrt(10)`, (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.  
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just `[[-2,2]]`.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[[3,3],[-2,4]]`  
**Explanation:** The answer `[[-2,4],[3,3]]` would also be accepted.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^4`

# todo

- need to explain
- time complexity for all the algos
- why does “quickselect with random pivot” achieve O(n) time
	- so this means it’s better than heaps?
- space complexity for all the algos is likely the same? ie all can be done in place?
	- heaps: you heapify either the first k elts or the whole array
- confirm from CLRS: the value you ‘sort by’: it’s called the ‘key’
- observation
	- ‘pre-computing’ keys uses O(n) space
	- computing the ‘key’ for a ‘record’ is very easy, so don’t pre-compute this; just compute them on-the-fly i.e. as needed

- brute force
	- a lot of sorting algorithms are actually not in place
- so brute force: space complexity depends on sorting algo





# Brute force search
- strategy
	- compute array of distances
	- sort nodes based on distance
	- pick first k entries of array
- complexity
	- time: depends on sorting algo
	- O(n) space for distance array
- optimization
	- O(1) space
		- observe: distance computation is relatively cheap
		- so don't compute array of distances at the start; instead just re-compute it for every node comparison during the sort


# observations
- sorting the whole array gives you "more info than you need", which suggests you're doing more computations than necessary
	- ie we know "m smallest" for any m, not just for $m=k$
- is there a cheaper 'sorting method' that just gives us "k smallest"? (yes...)

# Quick-select
```
def kClosest(self, points, k):
    d = lambda x,y: x**2 + y**2
    p, r = 0, len(points)-1
    while True:
        i = random.randrange(p,r+1)
        points[i], points[r] = points[r], points[i]
        q = p
        c = d(*points[r])
        for i in range(p, r):
            if d(*points[i]) <= c:  # how come code fails if i do <c ?
                points[i], points[q] = points[q], points[i]
                q += 1
        points[q], points[r] = points[r], points[q]
        if q<k-1:   # how come fails if i do q < k
            p = q+1
        elif q==k-1:
            break
        else:   # k-1<q
            r = q-1
    return points[:k]
```


- strategy
	- pick a pivot/node
		- (apparently random pivot results in better avg time complexity)
	- partition array based on this node: smaller stuff to the left, larger stuff to the right
	- if left subarray has size larger than k, then repeat steps 1 and 2 on it
- complexity
	- O(n) time, if randomly selected pivot
		- O(n^2) time in the worst case
	- O(1) space
		- in place
- note
	- apparently this process is like quicksort, but we recursively only sort 1 subarray (not both)
	- which subarray depends on whether the returned pivot index is below or less than k (the target num points)
	- aka quicksort would be a lot of unecessary computations, bc we dont need a full sort; which just need smallest k

# Heaps
```
def kClosest(self, points, k):
    # max heap
    f = -lambda x,y: x*x + y*y
    h = []
    for i, (x,y) in enumerate(points[:k]):
        heapq.heappush(h, (f(x,y), i))

    h = []

    return [points[i] for (_,i) in it]
```

max heap:
- strategy
	- build a max-heap of size k. pushpop the rest of the N-k elements. return the heap.
	- property: pop removes the max element. so the heap always has the k smallest elements you've streamed so far.
- O(k + N log k)  = O(N log k)
- commons errors
	- for the lambda/key function, actually need to return the negative of the distance
- optimization
	- would it be faster to build the array of tuples, and then run heapify?

min heap:
- not suggested for python; bc need to mess with the python heap library (since it's a max heap)
- strategy
	- build a min-heap of size N, and then pop k times (and return a list of what you popped)
	- property: pop removes the min element. 
- O(N + k log N)



(todo)
python errors:
if i do <c instead of <=c: the code doesn't finish on a major examples, looks like this:
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224222236.png)

also, observe that comparing q to k, i need to compare to k-1: this is because while k is the correct index i use for slicing: it's NOT correct for index access.
ie: will fail if you're fed a case where k = len(points), bc eventually randrange will get fed (k,k) as args, which is an error (empty range)
