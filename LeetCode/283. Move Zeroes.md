[283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
```

# Description

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`  
**Output:** `[1,3,12,0,0]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0]`  
**Output:** `[0]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

- check lc forums and see if there is more optimized solution



# Strategies


## swap if non-zero
- strat
	- iterate through array
		- maintain a `slow` pointer that keeps track of where the non-zero portion ends
			- aka: the last swap we performed
		- if currNum is non-zero, then:
			- move to slow
			- increment slow


- implementations
	- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0200-0299/move-zeroes-easy#approach-2-two-pointers-optimal
		- approach 1 is same
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/283
		- same

- optimization (to reduce swapping ops)
	- add a check: don’t do swaps if everything is nonzero so far
		- aka don’t do trivial swaps (aka swap number with itself)
	- idk if this is considered ‘reducing operations’ though..bc you now introduce a comparison operation
	- examples:
		- neetcode repo:
			- essentially add a check to not do anything, in case everything up to this point is nonzero
		- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0200-0299/move-zeroes-easy#approach-2-two-pointers-optimal
			- approach 2
			- written far more confusing bc they track count0
				- aka the complement of ‘nonzeros so far’
			- ‘swap if count0 > 0’ is literally same thing as ‘don’t swap if all nonzero so far’

        slow = 0
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            
            if nums[fast] != 0 and nums[slow] == 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]

            if nums[slow] != 0:
                slow += 1
```
