[10. Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)

```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        
```

# Description

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:
- `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "aa", p = "a"`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "aa", p = "a*"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = "ab", p = ".*"`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** `".*"` means "zero or more `(*)` of any character `(.)`".

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= p.length <= 20`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

# todo

#/strats 
- i'm almost certain this is an example where top-down is better than bottom-up
	- #/fundy i'm trying to find examples for this, but googling is unhelpful..no results when i search stuff like "example leetcode problems where top down is more efficient"
	- seems i'm looking for a problem where:
		- the dp table is very large (ie probly, multi dim)
			- https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/51178/dynamic-programming-speed-of-top-down-vs-bottom-up-approaches
		- not many subproblems required to compute a the current subproblem
		- the required subproblems are 'dynamic'
			- ie not dynamic is like:
				- if i was in 2d table, and the required subproblems were always the previous along each axis...then seems this would just require filling out the entire table
			- so 'dynamic' probly means that the required subproblems depend on 'choices'
				- and maybe in particular, one of the choices essentially/immediately bumps us to one subproblem 
				- like here: if matching char or `*`, then we get a diagonal move backward
	- and it seems this regex problem ticks all the above boxes
	- (i can easily confirm this by looking at the highest percentile submissions)
	- actually NO!
		- because: i'm fairly certain this problem can be solved with 1d structure optimization
		- i think 'top down better than bottom up' is just such a rare case, maybe that's why ppl don't give examples
			- aka not urgent
			- but would def be good to find one, eventually
		- the issue is that: if there arent many required subproblems:
			- then often, it seems you can do a 1d space optimization for the structure
		- so it seems, what we really might need is:
			- something where you only need like 1 subproblem, but the direction you jump will depend on a choice
				- but then this seems like what a greedy algo would do (so go finish greedy patterns first)
				- !!! yea CLRS seems to suggest this, see [[../_refs/02 algorithms/clrs.pdf#page=440|clrs, 15.1 An activity-selection problem]]
			- so now i'm thiking: what you need are jumps to subproblems that jump more than one step? but again...why wouldnt this be greedy..
			- aka: atm, i'm not ready to research/identify/look for problems, bc i dont understand greedy or dp fully yet

1. **Definition of Subproblems:**
   - **Strings:** Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` may contain wildcard characters like `?` (matches any single character) and `*` (matches zero or more characters), the task is to determine if `s1` matches `s2`.
   - **States:** Define `f(i, j)` as a boolean function indicating whether the prefix of `s1` of length `i` matches the prefix of `s2` of length `j`.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `f(0, 0)` is `true` since empty strings match.
   - For `i > 0` and `j = 0`, `f(i, 0)` is `false` since `s2` is empty and `s1` is not.
   - For `i = 0` and `j > 0`, `f(0, j)` is `true` only if `s1` contains only `*` characters up to index `j-1`. Otherwise, it's `false`.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For `i > 0` and `j > 0`:
     - If `s1[i-1]` matches `s2[j-1]` or `s1[i-1]` is `?`, then `f(i, j) = f(i-1, j-1)`.
     - If `s1[i-1]` is `*`, then `f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) || f(i, j-1)`. This covers the cases where `*` matches zero characters or one or more characters in `s2`.

4. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):**
   - Initialize a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`.
   - Use nested loops to iterate over `i` from `0` to `n` and `j` from `0` to `m`.
   - Compute `dp[i][j]` using the recurrence relation above.
   - Return `dp[n][m]`, which represents whether the entire `s1` matches `s2`.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - The tabulation method runs in O(n*m) time, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.

6. **Space Optimization:**
   - Since we only need the previous row's values for computation, we can use two rows instead of a full 2D DP table.
   - Initialize `prev` and `cur` arrays of size `m+1` to store the DP values for the previous and current rows.
   - Update `prev` and `cur` arrays accordingly in each iteration, using the same logic as above.
   - Return `cur[m]` as the final result.

By defining the subproblems, establishing base cases, and using dynamic programming, the speaker effectively solved the wildcard matching problem in a systematic and efficient manner.
