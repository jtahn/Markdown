[721. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        
```

# Description

Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** 
```
accounts = [
	["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],
	["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],
	["Mary","mary@mail.com"],
	["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]
]
```
**Output:**  
```
[
	["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],
	["Mary","mary@mail.com"],
	["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]
]
```
**Explanation:**  
```
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**
```
accounts = [
	["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],
	["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],
	["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],
	["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],
	["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]
]
```
**Output:**
```
[
	["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],
	["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],
	["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],
	["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],
	["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]
]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= accounts.length <= 1000`
- `2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30`
- `accounts[i][0]` consists of English letters.
- `accounts[i][j] (for j > 0)` is a valid email.

#/style 
- imo: it's too much clutter to have the tags be subheadings under the 'references' heading
	- also, some ideas are combos of refs...so it's hard to just pick one ref to put it under, without breaking up the flow a ton
- otoh...for many problems, it really is easy/natural to break it up into steps
	- and it really helps with reading, to be able to see the subheadings in the outline
- imo best is:
	- put tag in heading IF only 1 tag is used
	- otherwise:
		- do not put tags in headings; just list them right under the heading
		- the heading will just be like: mention all the 'leaf tags' that were used (so i don't have parent tags cluttering everything thing, unless mentioning a parent tag helps)
		- and when i revise: if i notice the heading name doesn't match up with tag names, then just change the heading name(bc i'm not using tags in headings: when i modify tag, it won't modify the heading)

# References


## #debug/input_format 
- each account: index 0 is the name
	- so to read emails, you start at index 1


## #graphs/model
- from description, we know that
	- merge accounts if there is some common email
	- common name tells us nothing
- model 1: 
	- nodes = emails
	- edges = emails belong to same account
	- leads to efficient strat:
		- dfs on undirect graph
- model 2:
	- nodes = accounts
	- edges = accounts share a common email
	- leads to efficient strat:
		- union-find on directed graph
	- for dfs: this seems like terrible time complexity:
		- the means: you want to: draw edges btwn accounts if they share an email
		- but now: to draw an edge: you have to:
			- for every pair of accounts, see if they share an email
		- and i can't see how to make this more efficient?

### is one model better than the other?
- dfs strat does seem to have very nice intuition...
	- if we draw all the induced edges, then 'common email = common node = accounts emails are in same connected component' means that we can just traverse the connected components
- so (why) is this 'classic union-find'? 
	- ie what about the 'nodes=emails'/dfs idea, makes it 'worse intuition'? (if indeed it is worse intuition)
	- if there is answer...likely is bc of the 'abstract formulation'/'pattern' of this problem?
		- or maybe it's as simple as: it's a merge problem, so just use union-find and set up your graph to optimize space

### is union-find unsuitable for model "nodes=emails"?
- !!! check todo, this discussion is possibly deprecated...there seems to e clean python code

- i suspect:
	- you should NOT do union-find on model 1
		- maybe something about the 'abstraction' of this problem..does not really return a graph that is suitable for pulling a result, without having a bunch of other structures
	- i think the abstract idea here is:
		- merging when there's like '2 levels' 
			- top level of distinct things
			- bottom level with possible duplicates
			- merging depends on bottom level
	- union-find on model 1:
		- the implementation is slightly more complicated
			- because the 'email to account' hashmap actually simplifies a lot of stuff for us
			- yea tbh, seems like you need something like this structure anyways...so then it's just better for nodes to be accounts...less space and less union operations
		- hashmap handles if node is already created
			- email to 'email node'
		- union each email with first email in the account
		- you'll need a structure that maps:
			- (some of the) emails to names
				- or to account (so that you can fetch the name for result)
		- then to get a list of all related emails:
			- either 'invert' the uf structure
				- bc: uf is an 'upward directed' tree...so you can't "start at root and get all emails" unless you invert it
				- if this is not traditional, then i should ignore this..or just jmention, this is not standard for how to collect each component
					- ie instead, its standard to have aux structures to facilitate this step
			- or do a process like in the 'uf of accounts' strat
				- (this is probably more traditional?)
				- grouping up the emails is no problem
				- the issue is finding the name associated with these emails
					- aka ultimately requires an '(some of the) emails to account/name' hashmap
						- all you really need is: 'representative email to name' hashmap
	





# Strategies





## dfs strat
- strat:
	- go through each account, and:
		- create email node if necessary
		- draw edges to connect these emails
	- after drawing edges for all accounts, observe that:
		- we have already 'merged' accounts
			- aka each connected component is exactly the emails that belong to the same person
		- bc when we draw edges for emails in the same account:
			- then accounts that share an email, will be connected
	- so the rest of the algo is simple:
		- traverse each connected component to gather (and sort) all the emails associated to a person


- each account: we find it's nodes, and add edges corresp to a connected subgraph

- if accounts share an email: then because we drew connected subgraphs: this means they're all connected
	- bc at least one common node: the common email


- 1. Perform dfs to find connected components, which we keep as `comps` with correspondences between number of component and list of emails in this component. We also keep set `seen` of visited nodes. In the end we just return sort all components and return then.


## dfs: graph construction choices
#graphs/representation
- how should we represent the graph?
	- use adjacency list

#/tbd 
- how should we draw edges?
	- tree
	- ie what initial edges should we draw?
		- what do we want/need:
			- all emails of an account need to be in same connected component
		- so there's no need to create a complete graph
			- once its connected: no benefit to drawing more edges
		- a tree is enough
			- recall tree is min num edges to connect nodes
				- aka connected acyclic
				- aka k-1 edges for k nodes
			- ie do star
				- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)
				- first email as the internal node of the star and all other emails as the leaves
	- (Q: is there any benefit of star, as opposed to ohter types of trees? ie line graph?)




## dfs (lc editorial)

1. Create an adjacency list: For each account add an edge between the first email (`accountFirstEmail`) and each of the other emails in the account.
2. Traverse over the accounts; for each account, check if the first email in the account (`accountFirstEmail`) was already visited. If so, then do not start a new DFS. Otherwise, perform DFS with this email as the source node.
3. During each DFS, store the traversed emails in an array `mergedAccount`, also mark all these emails as visited.
4. After the DFS traversal is over, sort the emails and add the account name (`accountName`) at the start of the vector `mergedAccount`.
5. Store the vector `mergedAccount` in the answer list `mergedAccounts`.


### complexity

- Time complexity is `O(a1 log a1 + ... ak * log ak)` where `ai` is the length of `accounts[i]`. 
	- derived from sorting each account
- Space complexity is `O(a1 + ... + ak)`.



- time O(nk log nk)
- space O(nk)

## dsu on accounts: strat overview

3 traversals:
- traverse over every account, and merge if common email
	- hashmap to track encountered emails
- traverse over every email, and add to representative's group
	- hashmap to collect merged account emails
- traverse over every group to build result



After processing all accounts, the groupByAccount dictionary is created to group emails by their main account (root of the disjoint set). This ensures that emails belonging to the same person are correctly identified.

### complexity
- time O(nk log nk)
- space O(nk)

## algomonster (dsu on accounts)

The implementation of the solution leverages the Union-Find algorithm and a hash map (email to accounts) to efficiently merge accounts.


1. Initialize each account as its own set by mapping it to an index.
2. Iterate through each account and each email within that account. For each email, we check if we've seen it before.
3. If we have, it means this email is common between accounts, and we need to merge these accounts (sets) into one. This is done by pointing the index of the current account to the index of the previously seen account with the same email. We achieve this by using the union-find algorithm.
4. If we have not seen the email before, we mark this email as visited and link it to the current account index.
5. Once all accounts are iterated through, we utilize a map that gathers all emails belonging to the same set (as identified by the find operation) together.
6. Lastly, we iterate through the map of merged accounts: for each set of emails, we first extract the account index, prepend the account name (since all emails in the set must belong to the same person), and sort the collection of emails.





### complexity


### time
The time complexity of the code is primarily determined by the following factors:

1. The iteration over each account and email to build the `email_id` mapping and perform union operations: This is `O(N * K)`, where `N` is the number of accounts and `K` is the average number of emails per account.
    
2. The path compression in the `find` function helps in keeping the union-find operations nearly constant time, at worst with amortized complexity `O(α(N))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function which grows very slowly.
    
3. Iterating over each account again and performing find operations on each email to build the `mp` mapping: This also takes `O(N * K)` time, as we are performing essentially constant-time operations per email.
    
4. Sorting of the email lists: In the worst case, if all emails end up in one set, the time complexity would be `O(E log E)`, where `E` is the total number of emails across all accounts.
    
5. Combining the names with the sorted emails: This can be considered `O(E)` as it is linear to the number of emails.
    

Thus, the overall time complexity would be `O(N * K + E log E)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the data structures used:

1. The parent list `p`, which is of size `O(N)`.
    
2. The `email_id` dictionary, which could contain at most `O(E)` email-to-account mappings.
    
3. The `mp` defaultdict, which can store `O(E)` email entries.
    
4. The output list, which would also contain `O(E)` email entries.
    

Therefore, the overall space complexity of the code is `O(N + E)`.




## when union-find is better than dfs
There is also union find solution, but because we need to sort our emails, time complexity, even for union find with ranks will be the same as for simple dfs.

bc The overall time complexity will be dominated with the sorting routines.

## #trees/union-find 

- directed graph where nodes are accounts
	- so 'representative' of each set, will also be an account


- hashmap:
	- tells you if we've already seen an email
	- aka this is a common email
	- aka we need to perform a union operation
	- aka this is the answer to question: 'when do we know to perform a merge'


- step 1: dsu to merge accounts
	- emails tell us when to merge
- step 2: collect all emails for each 'set of accounts'
	- hashmap holds emails, without duplicates
		- also tells us the first account it came with
	- use `uf.find` to figure out which 'representative account' to append this email to
- step 3:
	- add to result


- remember:
	- path compression
	- union by rank (ie less rank becomes child)
		- and update parent rank
