[110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220659.png)  
**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Example 2:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220708.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `root = []`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

# Brute force
- strategy
	- iterate over the nodes:
		- run a routine that checks whether its subtrees are balanced
			- (would be very similar to routine described in the post-order solution below)
- complexity
	- O(N^2) time
	- O(H) space (where H is height of the tree)
		- since binary tree..then isn't H = log N?
		- actually maybe not, bc it's not assumed to be balanced



# DFS
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return [True, 0]

            left, right = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            balanced = left[0] and right[0] and abs(left[1] - right[1]) <= 1
            return [balanced, 1 + max(left[1], right[1])]

        return dfs(root)[0]
```


alt code using an int to combine the depth and unbalanced info:

- jargon
	- post-order traversal
	- bottom-up
- idea
	- to determine whether it is unbalanced, a node needs to know the depth of its two children's subtrees
	- this depth info can be combined with a 'found unbalanced subtrees' indicator, that the node then propagates back to its parents (and thus to the root)
- implementation:
	- traversal can be done...
		- recursively
			- you have to write a recursive function inside the main function
			- bc the recursive function returns integer values
			- the wrapper main function returns a bool by comparing it to -1 (the integer we use to represent the unbalanced condition)
		- iteratively/manually via your own stack
	- sending depth AND unbalanced info can be done...
		- a pair (depth, foundUnbalanced)
		- an int (negative number signals unbalanced)
- strategy
	- traverse tree in post order / bottom up
	- each node asks children for their depth
	- one of the following will happen:
		- a child learns one if its descendants (possibly itself) is unbalanced, so it sends -1
		- the children send their depth, and they are unbalanced
		- the children are balanced
			- so the node computes it's own depth by adding 1 to max depth of the children
	- node will tell its parent its depth and/or if its unbalanced
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(H) space, where H is height of the tree
		- for recursion/dfs stack
- inspiration
	- careful: when thinking of inspo for this method: it is NOT true that: "if a node is unbalanced, then so are all its parents (so there's no need to check unbalanced for parents)"
		- ie can't use the above as a reason for "brute force does a lot of redundant work, because..."
		- assuming depth is calculated based on the deepest node
		- node could have 2 children that are unbalanced to the same depth; which mean the node itself is balanced
		- example: a 7 node tree that is just a vee; then the root is balanced (both subtrees are depth 3), but its children are unbalanced
			- 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
			- the dashes are edges
			- 4 is the root
			- 1,7 are the leaves
			- 4 is balanced, but it's children 3,5 are unbalanced
