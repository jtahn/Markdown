[692. Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        
```

# Description

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2`  
**Output:** `["i","love"]`  
**Explanation:** "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4`  
**Output:** `["the","is","sunny","day"]`  
**Explanation:** "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

#/strats 
- it seems all strats are two steps:
	- step 1: count
	- step 2: sort counts
- is there really no approach that efficiently combines these steps?

- also, see if my ‘select then sort’ idea is actually better than the ‘sort’ strats
	- btw #/jargon, is ‘select’ the official/rigorous term here?
	- ohhhh, wait this is exactly what the heap solution is almost certainly doing
		- word gets popped out of the heap if it’s not among the top k counts
		- ok, so this actually probly is a good ‘heap’ problem
	- imo imo still probly worth having a solution that explicitly separates this steps…
		- bc i think it’s valuable to point out how the heap basically combines these steps

- ok so nvm, so the strats are really like:
	- count, fully sort counts, pick first k
	- count, select first k, sort these k
	- (heap): count, sort AND select first k 
- seems like a very standard application of heaps
	- surely, picking first k in sorted order, is a common routine
	- and heap is the standard way to do it, bc:
		- streaming into the heap will select the first k
		- after we’ve streamed everything: popping will pop them out in sorted order




#/jargon 
- what should i call strats that are like:
	- i know it’s not optimal complexity
	- but it’s optimal wrt coding something very quickly via python features
	- which imo: likely a very valuable skill
		- ie if i just need to quickly whip up a script for one time use
	- for now, i’m using #python_enjoyer as a placeholder, it’s good meme hehe
		- imo #pythonic is not the right term here..bc this really just means ‘good style’…which isn’t a separate idea from ‘complex strat’ 
			- https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/
		- and ‘scripting’ doesn’t seem the right jargon here either
		- the general idea i’m going for here is like…code that is really attractive bc:
			- very short, because of how it uses python features
			- uses python features in a very obvious way
			- obviously correct



#/meta 
- for problems with very ‘complex’ solutions:
	- if there exists a much shorter solution involving typical/standard/common python features, then imo it’s worth including, even if worse complexity
	- ie this is the ‘best solution’ wrt ‘developer time efficiency’
	- aka #python_enjoyer 
- maybe: always write brute force solutions in this way
	- aka the underlying strat should be brute force
	- but it includes all possible #python_enjoyer type ‘optimizations’
	- aka, so there’s still something to learn from skimming the brute force solution
- also: even tho theoretical complexity differences can be large:
	- on many test cases, the #python_enjoyer might actually be faster
		- bc most of the computation is done with underlying C code, instead of your manual python code



# References


## #python/builtins_sort 

- define custom sorting function:
	- `f = lambda word: (-count[word], word)`
	- observe this achieves what we want:
		- first by freq in DESCENDING order
		- then lexicographically
	- to understand why the above works: need to know how python sorts
		- tuples
			- probly: lexicographic on each entry
		- strings
			- probly: usually lexicographic on each char
				- EXCEPT when string is purely a number?

```python
class Solution:
	def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
		word_count = Counter(words)
		f = lambda word: (-word_count[word], word)
		sorted_words = sorted(word_count, key=f)
		return sorted_words[:k]

## #/tbd (select then sort)
- surely there’s a strat that:
	- step 1: first select the top k words
	- then sorts these k words (bc output needs to be sorted)
- the idea being:
	- there’s no need to sort the entire list
