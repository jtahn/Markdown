```

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `["lint","code","love","you"]`  
**Output:** `["lint","code","love","you"]`  
**Explanation:** One possible encode method is: `"lint:;code:;love:;you"`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `["we", "say", ":", "yes"]`  
**Output:** `["we", "say", ":", "yes"]`  
**Explanation:** One possible encode method is: `"we:;say:;:::;yes"`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.
	- Your algorithm should be generalized enough to work on any possible characters.
- Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.
- Do not rely on any library method such as `eval` or serialize methods. You should implement your own encode/decode algorithm.

# todo
- lit search: does a general concept exist here
	- i highly suspect this is like a very general technique/approach
	- ie what is the generalized version of ‘sending a message’?
	- ie something where: the cost of ‘sending a message’ is constant, so the idea here is: how do we combine multiple messages into one
	- maybe an example is like: ‘api calls’?
	- so similarly: the general strategy here is just: the way you figure out how to ‘split’ up messages is: you prepend with something that tells you how ‘long’ the next partial message is
		- ie the strategy is NOT to have some kind of ‘flag’ that tells you this is where you split
		- instead: the ‘flag’ tells you when the next ‘flag’ occurs
		- ie: use flags to tell you about the next split, not the current split
		- this probably only works if there’s some kind of obvious ‘start’ for the message...ie here, its just beginning of the message..so this is where the first flag goes
			- also needs to be some kind of obvious ‘this is how you iterate through the message’






# 'Prepend lengths'
```
class Solution:
    def encode(self, strs):
        res = ""
        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s):
        res = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != '#':
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            i = j + 1
            j = i + length
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i = j
            
        return res
```


- observation
	- if you only use delimiters, then you have to worry about if the delimiters are actually used in the string...this seems like a nightmare..either impossible, or need lots of escape characters or complex parsing logic
- strategy
	- incorporate length into the delimiter; so we know exactly when the next delimiter appears
		- prepend each string with the length of each string, in a consistent manner
		- aka add a header that represents the length of each string
		- so the encoding will look like: `header-payload-header-payload-...`
	- question: how to determine whether we're reading the length vs the string itself?
		- option 1: delimiter (example above uses `#`)
			- as long as delimiter is never used in the header, then this is fine bc you know:
				- if you haven't seen the delimiter yet (ie if you keep getting digits), then you're still reading in the length
				- the first time you see delimiter, this is the delimiter btwn length and actual string (bc length itself doesn't have the delimiter)
			- this is probably the better/more flexible solution, bc works for unbounded length for strings
		- option 2: fixed-width header
			- works here bc there's an upper bound on length of the string
			- specifically: bc length at most 200, we know that 3 characters/digits is enough to store the length
				- (tho the example below uses 4 characters)
			- just pad with zeros when the length isn't 3 digits
				- i.e. use `{:3}.format(len(s))`
				- this avoids ambiguity: since the length prefix is fixed-width, there is no confusion about where the header starts and ends
				- i.e. when then when you decode, it's as simple as
					- `length = int(s[i:i+3])`
- complexity (let n be combined/ttl length of all strings)
	- O(n) time
		- bc for both encode/decode, need to iterate through count n characters
	- O(n) space
		- ? bc you have to construct a new string / array of strings
