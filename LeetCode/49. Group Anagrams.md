[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        
```

# Description
Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**` strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`  
**Output:** `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `strs = [""]`  
**Output:** `[[""]]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `strs = ["a"]`  
**Output:** `[["a"]]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

	- choosing a key / picking a representative
	- there is definitely a 'math term' for the concept i'm looking for here
		- ie same key iff same group
		- kinda like partition
	- to identify anagrams: we need to generate something so that they result in the same thing iff anagram


- [1. Two Sum](1.%20Two%20Sum.md)
	- when hashing:
		- use a dict if you need to do an ‘action’ that is informed by the existence check
			- ie action requires details about the existence (ie not just the fact that there is a collision)
		- use a set if 'existence of a collission' is all you need
		- correct jargon for 'hashmap' (is it hashmap?)
			- ie generalization of set and dict
			- (bc doesnt seem like they're generalizations of each other)
	- either here, or in fundy for sets and set implementations in python
		- (or maybe better: fundy for hashing/hash functions/hashmaps)
		- (actually some of this stuff should go do valid anagrams; ie comparing hashmaps in python)
		- general overview of 'hashing'
			- hash function
		- dictionary/set implementations in python
			- why key lookup is O(1)
				- (or maybe this should be discussed in fundy for python set implementations problem for sets; and then i'll cite the explanation here, and say 'same arg')
			- copy stuff from realpython article
				- diff ways to initialize a dict
				- diff ways to add items and handle missing keys
				- defaultdict
					- common factory functions
						- list, tuple
				- Counter
					- actually two-sum doesn't use counter...imo diff problem should be fundamental for "Counter"
						- it's fine to split up counter; two-sum alrdy has a ton of stuff; and i'll have a TOC for 'fundamental topics'

# Results

## python: hashable container types
- in python, what containers are hashable
	- tuples are
	- lists arent?
	- dicts arent?




## intermediate 'existence'
- interpret 'repeated comparisons'/'groups' as an existence problem
- it's true that this problem can be considered a 'comparison' problem
	- ie [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md)
	- ie, 'do repeated comparisons'
	- but this is not the best interpretation
- instead: consider it an existence problem
	- ie check if already started a group of its anagram
- more generally: if a question is asking you to 'group things up'
	- it might be tempting to interpret this as: "the problem is asking us to compare things to determine if they belong to the same group"
	- but instead: you should interpret this as an existence problem: "we need to determine if this item belongs to a group that already exists"
- why existence? bc we know we can efficiently do this via hashmaps
	- the problem then becomes: figuring out what key to use for each group
		- ie what key has best complexity for us
- possible big idea/summary
	- in computing, hashmaps means that existence checks/storage are relatively efficient
		- bc hashmap ops will only require O(1) time and O(n) space
	- so while they might not always be the 'best approach'; it's never the 'worst'
	- so see if you can devise a technique that essentially boils down to existence checks, that gives you a good baseline algo


- key idea
	- if we need to make repeated existence checks:
		- immediately think about using a hash map
			- how do we use hashing?
				- think about what we need to check existence of
				- here: it’s of a ‘group of elements that aren’t identical’’
				- so we need to determine a hashable key that we can assign to each group
					- same key iff same group
				- from ‘valid anagram’
					- is it actually true that the optimal choice here is ‘structure of the counts’?
					- optimal choice
						- depends on what structures are hashable
							- i feel like other languages, dicts aren’t hashable..you’d have to implement your own hash function, which seems annoying / out of scope of this problem
							- if dictionary isnt hashable; then need to use a tuple of counts
							- but tuple is size of alphabet...if alphabet is large, this might not be efficient
						- so it also depends on ‘size of alphabet’ versus ‘size of words’
						- iirc for this problem in python: you use tuple of counts
							- O(n) time

# todo

## to writeup style
- do not need to be that comprehensive about citing everything properly
	- i'll be reviewing everything forever
	- code examples will help jog memory
		- even without 'detailed explanation', can trust brain to fill in the gaps / make connections
		- aka inductive learning
	- so during reviews, I generally won't even reference the links anyways
	- (but obvi: if I immediately remember what should be cited: then might as well)


# Implementations

## (global observations)
- what to choose as a key
	- (see: [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md))
	- array/dict of counts
		- O(m) time  (for word length m)


## Repeated comparisons
- implementations
	- brute force

```
code
```



- strategy
	- use a list of lists to store anagrams
		- each inner list stores all the words that are anagrams of each other
	- iterate through the words: for each word:
		- check if its an anagram with an arbitrary member of each group
		- if no matches, then create its own group
- complexity (n is num word, m is length of longest string)
	- O(n^2 m)
		- O(n) from iterating over the words
		- then for each word: 
			- O(m) to compute that word's letter counts
			- another O(m) for each representative we have to check
				- worst case, no words are anagrams: so then checking all representatives is O(mn)
			- so O(m+mn) total
		- so O(n(m+mn))
	- space
		- O(nm) bc we want result to store the actual words

## Existence
- implementations
	- dictionary


```
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```


- here: we use dict:
	- bc we need ‘action’: group items together


- observation:
	- whatever check we do, the result can be hashed and used as a key; which means checking representatives now only takes O(1) time, instead of O(m)
	- ACTUALLY: we're not even checking representatives; we just append it to a group
	- so there's 2 speedups here: not only do we not have to recompute letter counts for representatives; but actually, there's no comparison step either. bc we just store the word at the key
		- the 'first' speedup is the real speedup
- strategy
	- use dictionary to store groups of anagrams
- complexity
	- time
		- O(mn)  
			- O(n) to loop over each word
			- for each word
				- O(m) to compute its key (via letter counts)
					- generally O(m log m) if you use sorted word as the key
				- O(1) to store word at the key
	- space
		- O(nm) bc solution array requires the actual words
