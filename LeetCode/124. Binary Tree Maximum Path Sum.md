[124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```

# Description
A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227114743.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,2,3]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The optimal path is `2 -> 1 -> 3` with a path sum of `2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227114752.png)  
**Input:** `root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]`  
**Output:** `42`  
**Explanation:** The optimal path is `15 -> 20 -> 7` with a path sum of `15 + 20 + 7 = 42`.  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

- when you need to run a routine on children, before current node can do anything

- when to use it
- alternative: this 'array trick' that he does in the video
	- ohhhhh I think it's because: list is mutable, so you can modify contents...
	- but without 'nonlocal' keyboard: when you modify 'primitive' variable (or is it specifically, 'non mutable container') in the inner function, then the enclosing function likely won't see the change
	- I should probably have some kind of 'debug' card that address concepts related to this
- maybe this problem is actually the fundy for it?
	- basically used in a recursive algo, that updates a 'global max'



# Results

## tree: path is vertex + 2 downward paths
- possibly equivalently: 'use post order to compute paths in trees'


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)
	- Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent

- figure out the correct jargon here
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#Terminology


- this definition means that a path in any tree is equivalent to:
	- a node plus at most 2 downward paths through some descendants
	- ie can change vertical direction at most once

	- i highly suspect this interpretation is the standard technique for writing algos wrt paths in trees
		- bc it very naturally connects with post order traversal 
		- aka: the aux routine is essentially:
			- node calls aux on children
			- each child returns info regarding 'best downward path rooted at this child'
				- note this could be edge cases like 'no path' or 'only the child'
			- node runs routine computing 2 things:
				- A: determines 'best downward path rooted at node'
				- B: determines best path with node as vertex
					- aka pick at most 2 of the paths provided by children
			- node uses B to update a global var 
			- node return A to parent

```python

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        res = [root.val]

        # return max path sum without split
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0

            leftMax = dfs(root.left)
            rightMax = dfs(root.right)
            leftMax = max(leftMax, 0)
            rightMax = max(rightMax, 0)

            # compute max path sum WITH split
            res[0] = max(res[0], root.val + leftMax + rightMax)
            return root.val + max(leftMax, rightMax)

        dfs(root)
        return res[0]
