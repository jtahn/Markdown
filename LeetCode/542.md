Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return _the distance of the nearest_ `0` _for each cell_.

The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

**Example 1:**
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224223053.png)
**Input:** `mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`
**Output:** `[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`

**Example 2:**
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224223102.png)
**Input:** `mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]`
**Output:** `[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]`

**Constraints:**
- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- There is at least one `0` in `mat`.

(ignore complexity for now, until i figure out a trustworthy reference)
apparently running BFS on a node is O(nm) because:

![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224223201.png)



# Brute force search (via BFS)
- run a BFS on every node
- $O(n^2 m^2)$ time: BFS is  $O(mn)$ , and need to run it for each node (count  $nm$ )
-  $O(nm)$  space: a queue for the BFS (can be reset after each completed BFS), and for an array to save min distances for each nodes

# BFS (called once)
```
def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n,m = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    queue = []
    queue = collections.deque(queue)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if mat[i][j] == 0:
                queue.append((i,j))
    while queue:
        r,c = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:
            i,j = neighbor
            if 0<=i<n and 0<=j<m and mat[i][j]==1:
                mat[i][j] = mat[r][c]-1
                queue.append((i,j))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            mat[i][j] *= -1
    return mat
```
- idea
	- "flip" the problem: ie start on 0s instead of 1s
- strategy
	- initialize queue with the 0 cells
	- for each pop:
		- check if neighbors (if they exist, ie in bounds) have unknown distance
		- if unknown: then neighbor.distance = cell.distance + 1
- common errors
	- pop instead of popleft
	- forgetting if `mat[i][j]==0` condition for initial
	- using np indexing `[i,j]` instead of `[i][j]`
	- `Collections` instead of `collections`
- Optimizations
	- keeping track of visited nodes without creating a separate data structure:
		- observe that "valid neighbor" can include neighbor.value=1
		- so then just set `neighbor.value = -neighbor.distance = -cell.distance-1`
			- need to do negative, bc need cells w/ distance 1 to be invalid after we explore them
		- and then after BFS, go through array and switch to positive
- complexity
	- still O(mn) space because of the queue


# Dynamic programming
Complexity:
- Time O(nm)
- Space O(1)

observations
- distance = x distance plus y distance
- this means that distance to nearest 0 node: can do this by:
1. compute smallest x distances
2. using those numbers: compute smallest y distances.


(this is essentially what ppl mean when they say 'you only need 1 turn for a minimum path',
which results in this code where they do a SE pass and  NW pass;
but this isn't the 'correct' intuition)
(and no one seems to be able to convincingly explain why 2 passes gets you the shortest path coming from a NE or SW direction) 

---

anyways, then imo code should be:
- do passes in each direction for dim 0
- do passes in each direction for dim 1

both codes below aren't what i have in mind.
they are equivalent, but it's not the order i'm saying above (which imo aligns with the most intuitive explanation)
