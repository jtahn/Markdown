[134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i^th` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i^th` station to its next `(i + 1)^th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:**  
```
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:**  
```
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == gas.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`

# todo

#/meta 
- this problem is also another example of neetcode not being an expert
	- first 4 problems in the 'greedy' group are not 'greedy' algorithms imo
		- and maybe more too, i have to check them
	- and also of neetcode being slightly annoying to rely on
		- it's just the nature of video format
		- cannot edit/revise vids
		- so sometimes, code does not match up with vid

#/meta
- completely unecessary to know but i'm so curious:
	- the two examples: observe that `cost` is just a permutation of `gas`
	- the problem says that if solution exist, then it's guaranteed to be unique
	- question: are there special types of permutations that aer equivalent to 'solution exists'
		- and similarly, for 'solution is unique'
	- NEVER MIND (for the first question)...i'm blind...the second example, the cost is not a permutation
		- so 'existence' might be as simple as: soln exists IFF `sum(gas) >= sum(cost)`
		- however: uniqueness is stil interesting to think about

#/fundy 
- imo it's not actually obvious that
	- soln exists IFF `sum(gas) >= sum(cost)`
	- so this needs to be explained

#/strats 
- from all the discussion of other strats below, i now realize:
	- the actual code that neetcode writes in his vid, is the 'forward iteration + math proof' solution
	- the code on his website/repo is the 'two-pointer' solution
- imo: definitely have both solutions
	- bc they rely on very different observations
		- strat 1: points along invalid trip cannot be a start point
		- strat 2: efficient subroutine
			- wait: this actually requires observation from strat 1
			- 'start points': enough to only check leftward, bc you know nothing rightward can be a start
	- but imo the second one is more 'natural' strat, even if the code is more complicated
		- it essentially comes directly from the 'brute force' strat, bc we can optimize iteration for the subroutine
		- btw maybe #/fundy 
			- if subroutine involves linear pass starting from current index
			- maybe this is a strong indication to consider a two-pointer approach
				- 'left' for start index; 'right' for linear pass
				- aka think about whether the linear passes are making redundant computations
			- and this is the only example i've encountered where pointers move outward
				- ie previous examples: pointers move inward, or same direction
				- maybe the fundy here is:
					- if 'invalid start' means 'everything along curr linear pass is also invalid':
						- then pointers should move outward
				- note: maybe strat 1 could be considered two pointer?
					- right pointer manages the trip
					- if trip invalid: then jump left pointer to the right's location
					- otoh: i feel like 'two pointer' should not allow 'pointers can jump more than 1 index'
					- like the idea in past problems seems to be:
						- at every step, you check your conditions
						- and conditions determines whether you move the left or right by exactly 1 index
		- versus the first one relies on the "existence IFF ineqaulity btwn sums"
			- which imo is not at all immediate to realize
		- wait the first one, you don't actually need that observation at all to still achieve O(n) time
			- without the 'math' realization: it's fine to wrap around array to continue checks
			- you just break/false once your 'candidate start' is traveled around the array at least once
			- this means worst case, you do like two passes through the array
				- ie: if you end up having the last index be a 'candidate start'
				- and then to check this start (and it is valid), then you have to traverse entire array
			- this means that the 'math IFF' is really an 'optimization', but is not the main inspo for this strat
				- so imo..two pointer is 'better'/'true inspo'

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJwbPZGo05A&list=PLPe9IkX86X3y5m_MvtNu2ughxsvkqUNKr&index=125
	- imo the brute force solution is worth having at some point?
		- #/fundy "it's really the differences that matter" is a really clean way to interpret this problem
			- (note: don't actually need to compute a differences array)
		- so i like how brute force soln will really isolate this observation

	- his explanation for 'greedy' approach makes sense
		- first compute sums to see if possible or not
		- then you only need to do one pass (don't have to loop back around array, bc alrdy know the earlier stuff aren't solutions; so if later stuff in array works until end of array, you kinda know it works the entire time bc earlier stuff didn't work)
		- but his explanation also makes me think: his solution is NOT greedy
	- also: his 'greedy' explanation is making me think:
		- there is way to interpret this problem as 'jump game' on the differences array
		- the difficulties are that:
			- you now have negative jumps
			- circular array
				- tho this isn't really an issue / doesn't have to be 'verified', using same arg for his 'greedy' approach
				- #/fundy what i mean (and i tihnk it's an interesting observation): the routine/'check' that is associated with (starting at) an index, doesn't have to wrap around the array
					- understand why this is the case, and whether it can be abstracted
		- yes: see https://algo.monster/liteproblems/134
			- the solution explanation seems very similar to the 'reverse iteration' strat that neetcode provided for jump game
				- there seem to be errors in the explanation... and/or things aren't convincing at all
			- actually algomonster seems like a diff idea, and it really does seem like two pointer
				- imo it's not really like 'reverse iteration' from jump game..it does incorporate that idea, but it's such a minor part of the strat that it's not a good comparison at all
			- the idea is:
				- left pointer is 'current start candidate'
				- right pointer is 'current trip exploration'
				- conditions on when to move the pointers:
					- left: run out of gas on current trip
						- bc this cannot be start
						- keep moving it back until we have enough gas for current trip
					- right pointer
						- we still have valid gas
						- so we can continue journey
				- once the left and right pointers meet:
					- if negative gas, then trip is impossible
					- if 0 or positive: then trip starts here
				- so note: we really could have started the two pointers at any index; doesn't have to be the last
				- the big realization here is that:
					- initializing a journey for every index (aka start point) does redundant work wrt computing 'relative changes in gas'
					- bc any two journeys have really large overlapping journey portion
				- ok so this strat/problem needs to #/move to two-pointer
					- and one of the key realizations/fundies is the observation about 'differences'
						- aka 'relative changes in gas'
						- this is a subroutine that is repeatedly calculated; but can be carried over to adjacent journeys
						- so this is #iteration/two-pointer via #iteration/for_subroutine 
		- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0100-0199/gas-station-medium
			- does not seem to do reverse iteration
			- seems it's probly a similar idea though?
				- might be the analogue to 'forwards iteration' for jump game
			- importantly, they call it 'two-pointer'
				- (aka again confirming to me..i don't think any of these algos are 'greedy')
			- ok this kinda seems like neetcode
				- they run a check to confirm a solution exists
				- this is probly what lets them 'reset' the total gas
					- which imo is equivalent to 'not having to circle back around the array to confirm whether journey is valid'
			- #/strats i'm now thinking that neetcode/hardway is either a different strat from algomonster
				- or maybe they're just using the 'we can efficiently carry over relative changes in gas' in a different way, and then combning thisw ith the idea that 'if we know there is a solution, then we don't have to verify the portion of journey that wraps around'
			- idea
				- note: total_gas being initialized to -1
					- this is for a sentinel value
				- i understand now; this code is same strat as the baihugian/lcForum solution below
				- and it is definitely NOT two pointer
					- at least, not the way i interpret two pointer
				- i suspect: they changed the code bc they think this strat is 'better', but forgot to change the name
			- tbh i think hardway's variable naming is the better way to write this strat, once you understand it (compared to what is in the neetcode vid)
				- BUT do not use the zip/enumerate imo...there's no real need, and makes it more complicated to understand
				- unless...is 'zip+enumerate' more efficient?
					- bc maybe then it does the subtraction in C instead of python
					- if so, maybe worth knowing this
					- ie #/fundy for python enumerate+zip
					- and also tbh it kind of really emphasizes that it's purely the differences we care about

	- this guy has proofs/explanation i was talking about, for:
		- forwards iteration linear solution
		- existence IFF inequality btwn sums
	- also #/refs this guy seems reliable!
		- 

- https://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/8ngvdt/how_to_solve_this_leetcode_problem/dzvfbkk/
	- the second commenter/reply is probly correct, but does NOT seem like natural/correct inspo for this problem

- ! wait
	- https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/solutions/1706142/java-c-python-an-explanation-that-ever-exists-till-now/
		- this is forwards iteration
			- and doesn't even need two pointer
		- if journey fails, then we know everything along journey can't be starting point either
			- bc considering that as the starting point: we'd have less gas
			- since it was a valid point on the previous journey: means we were carrying over gas, aka we actually had more gas when this is NOT a starting point
		- imo this is a completely different interpretation of the problem
			- and a very good one as well
		- idk what to #/jargon this...seems like a 'math/proofy' solution as well
- #/research 
	- striver doesn't have a 'gas stations' problem
		- but i suspect he uses a different name
		- and given my understanding of the idea behind strats above..i suspect it's either in an 'array' or 'two-pointer' playlist
		- (similarly, check EPI)


# Strategies


## neetcode
```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        start, end = len(gas) - 1, 0
        total = gas[start] - cost[start]

        while start >= end:
            while total < 0 and start >= end:
                start -= 1
                total += gas[start] - cost[start]
            if start == end:
                return start
            total += gas[end] - cost[end]
            end += 1
        return -1

```
