[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

# References
## solution is extreme value
- key = max profit of buying on a day:
	- Highest price in the future
- or: key = max profit of selling on a day
	- Lowest Price in the past
- solutions is max over keys


## one way max only requires 1 pass
- can precompute and store in array
- Or maintain a pointer; see kadane’s below


## Kadane’s (pointer instead of array)
- actually, imo this isn’t really used…ie reasoning for why ‘iterate each sell day’ is more efficient, is way more fundamental than this…





# Results
## flip problem
- instead of: ‘for buy day, what is best sell day’
	- Do: ‘for sell day, what is best buy day’
- Todo: here, I’m p sure flipping is strictly better
	- Ie can’t get an optimal algo by doing the first interpretation
	- So what is the general idea behind why this is the case?


# Approaches
## iterate all pairs
- strategy
	- for each valid pair of buy/sell days
		- (valid = buy day is strictly before sell day)
		- compute profit
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- O(1) space


## iterate each buy day
- implementations
	- Brute force
		- For each day, determine future max
	- Dynamic programming
		- Precompute future maxes
		- Compute keys (max profit per day)
		- Take max over keys


## iterate each sell day
- implementations
	- Brute force
	- Dynamic programming
	- Pointer

```
# pointer
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

    max_profit_seen = 0 
    lowest_price_seen = prices[0]
    
    for price in prices:
        max_profit_seen = max(max_profit_seen, price-lowest_price_seen)
        lowest_price_seen = min(lowest_price_seen, price)
        
    return max_profit_seen
```

- observation
	- let `maxprofit([0,j])` be "max profit during days 0 through j"
	- `maxprofit([0,j])` is max of: 
		- `maxProfit([0,j-1])`
		- "max profit with sell day j"
			- corresponds to buying on the lowest price day `i` on `[0, j-1]`
- strategy
	- loop through the array
		- track/update "max profit so far" and "lowest price so far"
		- at the start of every iteration:
			- "lowest price so far" helps you compute "max profit with sell day j"
			- "max profit so far" is `maxProfit([0,j-1])`
		- so during the iteration:
			- compute the new "max profit so far"
			- update "lowest price so far"
