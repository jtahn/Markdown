[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

# Brute force search
- strategy
	- for each valid pair of buy/sell days
		- (valid = buy day is strictly before sell day)
		- compute profit
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- O(1) space

# Dynamic programming

```
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

    max_profit_seen = 0 
    lowest_price_seen = prices[0]
    
    for price in prices:
        max_profit_seen = max(max_profit_seen, price-lowest_price_seen)
        lowest_price_seen = min(lowest_price_seen, price)
        
    return max_profit_seen
```

- observation
	- let `maxprofit([0,j])` be "max profit during days 0 through j"
	- `maxprofit([0,j])` is max of: 
		- `maxProfit([0,j-1])`
		- "max profit with sell day j"
			- corresponds to buying on the lowest price day `i` on `[0, j-1]`
- strategy
	- loop through the array
		- track/update "max profit so far" and "lowest price so far"
		- at the start of every iteration:
			- "lowest price so far" helps you compute "max profit with sell day j"
			- "max profit so far" is `maxProfit([0,j-1])`
		- so during the iteration:
			- compute the new "max profit so far"
			- update "lowest price so far"
