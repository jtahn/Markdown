[846. Hand of Straights](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)

```python
class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        
```

# Description

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i^th` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** `Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]`

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= hand.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`

**Note:** This question is the same as [1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/).

	- again..i'm not sure how neetcode video is 'greedy'
	- vid uses: hashmap of counts + minheap for unused vals
		- also uses obervation that: groups must start with the 'min unused val'
		- reminds me of that problem where you were finding connected components of consecutive sequences, and could do this efficiently bc of 'representatives'
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/846
	- similar to neetcode vid
		- does hashmap + sorted input
- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0800-0899/hand-of-straights-medium#approach-1-greedy-using-sorting-and-a-hash-map
	- like algomonster: hashmap+sorted input
	- they call it greedy, but their reasoning is unconvincing to me
		- aka again, i don't think this is greedy
- #/jargon 
	- idk what to even call this strat tbh
	- the key idea here is 'representative for each group/component'
		- it's interesting that we now use it on a problem where the array doesn't uniquely split into 'disjoint' components
		- so i think that #/fundy about representatives is actually distinct from 'connected components' fundy
