[759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)

```python
# Definition for an Interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, start: int = None, end: int = None):
#         self.start = start
#         self.end = end

class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: '[[Interval]]') -> '[Interval]':
	    
```

# Description

We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for _all_ employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined). Also, we wouldn’t include intervals like `[5, 5]` in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]`  
**Output:** `[[3,4]]`  
**Explanation:** There are a total of three employees, and all common free time intervals would be `[-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf]`.  
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren’t finite.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]`  
**Output:** `[[5,6],[7,9]]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
- `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

#/strats 
- i’m almost certain i saw this in EPI
- this is likely a classic problem, or an obvious variant



- this is a very nice problem tbh
	- the ‘naive’ solution has 2 major steps
		- flatten and sort
		- merge + compute complements
	- and then there are classic optimizations for each step
		- pq
		- greedy
- and i think it’ll be helpful to have the ‘naive’ strat right before the ‘pq + greedy’ strat
- !! see comment below, there is a third and ‘best’ solution
	- i still think it’s important to keep above 2…really highlights how greedy you can be when things are sorted
	- and maybe some kind of generalization about why/when ‘flattening’ is unnecessary




- OHHHHH!!!
	- ok even the pq+greedy approach…this is very likely not the best!
		- there should be no need to ‘flatten’ (and thus, no need to sort as well)!!
		- yes!! basically/probably:
			- use pq to make sure you’re looking at intervals in sorted order
			- then use the ‘greedy’ observation to know when we have free time
			- this means that the only aux structure required is for the pq, and so we should have:
				- time `O(mk log k)`
					- and better constant than the ‘flatten’ approach, bc we only read each interval once
					- in the ‘flatten’ approach, we read through each interval twice
						- first to create the ‘flattened’ containr
						- second (as we iterate over ‘flattened’) to determine free time
				- space `O(k)`
	- check yt results https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=employee+free+time+leetcode
		- #/meta definitely worth being aware of lots of approaches + structures + getting better at reading/skimming code
			- 1 way it helps: it’s actually quite easy/quick to determine if it’s worth looking deeper into a writeup or yt vid
			- skimming code, i can quickly determine general structure + approach, and know if it’s basically same strat as something i’ve already considered
		- ie see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTgF52uGK0Y&pp=ygUbZW1wbG95ZWUgZnJlZSB0aW1lIGxlZXRjb2Rl
			- sweep line!
			- #/meta even tho this is in chinese, i suspect it’s still very convenient to figure out, bc they specifically label jargon and related problems
			-

## #/tbd 

- remember to consider full structure of input
	- if you perform a step that still works on more general input, then be suspicious: you can probly optimize it
	- importantly: if you are given input that is sorted in some way, but your approach still works if completely unsorted


## #priority_queue 

- see below, aka [[23. Merge k Sorted Lists]]



## #greedy/sort 

- so that we don’t actually have to perform an extra pass to perform ‘merges’
- #/cleanup i need to more clearly explain this; it’s def not immediately obvious, and imo it’s pretty important actually, and should generalize easily
	- actually probly doesnt generalize…its just another ‘greedy trick’ that i’ll need to ‘memorize’


# Strategies

## pq + greedy

- strat
	- flatten and sort intervals
	- merge overlapping intervals
		- so now we have a list of non-overlapping intervals where any employee is working
	- then the answer is just the complement of that list
		- ie: for each pair of intervals, we have free time interval `(interval1.end, interval2.start)`
- implementation
	- in the flatten and sort step:
		- could just naively:
			- flatten the schedules array
			- and then sort the 1d list
			- so this is like `O(mk log mk)` time
				- where `k=num employees` and `n=max length of an employee sched`
				- so `mk = approx ttl num intervals`
		- but: bc each employee’s list is already sorted:
			- i highly suspect can use a heap to do this more efficiently
				- aka [[23. Merge k Sorted Lists]]
			- heap should just contain next unsorted interval for each employee
			- so then overall time should be like `O(mk log k)`
	- actually (and i think this is a idea / trick that feels #greedy/sort ):
		- the ‘merge’ and ‘compute complement’ steps don’t need to be separate, bc you can figure out free time as you pass through
			- see https://algo.monster/liteproblems/759
			- iterate through flattened sorted list:
				- free time only happens if `interval1.end < interval2.start`
