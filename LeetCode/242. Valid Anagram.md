[242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

```
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
```

# Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "rat", t = "car"`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

# Results

## python dictionary basics 
- (Meta) this card should now become a comprehensive discussion about using counting (and comparing counts) in python

- data structure choices
	- array
	- dictionary
	- default dict
	- Counter   
- using the data structures
- comparing data structures + optimizations
- don't forget Counter stuff
	- Counter.most_common()   
- key lookup is (probly) O(1) in python
	- discuss that in other languages, this isn't guaranteed
		- (in python these apparently arent big concerns)
		- is key lookup/access O(1)
			- or is it O(log n)
			- in cpp, depends on what std container you use...be careful
		- collisions

# Approaches

## check all permutations (aka brute force)
- strategy
	- for each permutation/anagram of `s`, check for equality with `t`
- complexity
	- time probably $O(n!)$

## Sort and compare
```
def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```
- strategy
	- Sort, then compare for equality
- complexity
	- depends on sorting algo


## Count and compare
```
def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

    counts_s = {}
    counts_t = {}

    ###########################
    # Body:
    # update counts_s, counts_t
    ###########################
    
    return counts_s == counts_t
```
- strategy
	- use a structure to store letter counts
		- dictionary or array
	- iterate through each string and store counts
	- compare counts
- python
	- oneliner via Counter class
- complexity
	- $O(n)$ time
		- O(n) to iterate through each string once to compute counts
		- O(1) to iterate through structures to compare counts
	- $O(1)$ space
		- 2 structures, each of size at most 26
