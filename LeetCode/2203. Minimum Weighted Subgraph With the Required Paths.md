# Description

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from `from_i` to `to_i` with weight `weight_i`.

Lastly, you are given three **distinct** integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return _the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach_ `dest` _from both_ `src1` _and_ `src2` _via a set of edges of this subgraph_. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240419231308.png)  
**Input:** `n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5`  
**Output:** `9`  
**Explanation:**  
The above figure represents the input graph.  
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.  
Note that the subgraph `[[1,0,3],[0,5,6]]` also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240419231336.png)  
**Input:** `n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:**  
The above figure represents the input graph.  
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.

**Constraints:**
- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= from_i, to_i, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`
- `from_i != to_i`
- `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.
- `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5`
