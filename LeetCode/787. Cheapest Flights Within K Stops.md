[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [from_i, to_i, price_i]` indicates that there is a flight from city `from_i` to city `to_i` with cost `price_i`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from_ `src` _to_ `dst` _with at most_ `k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240418142214.png)  
**Input:** `n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1`  
**Output:** `700`  
**Explanation:**  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.  
Note that the path through cities `[0,1,2,3]` is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240418142225.png)  
**Input:** `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1`  
**Output:** `200`  
**Explanation:**  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.  

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240418142236.png)  
**Input:** `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0`  
**Output:** `500`  
**Explanation:**  
The graph is shown above.  
The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `flights[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
- `from_i != to_i`
- `1 <= price_i <= 10^4`
- There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
- `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
- `src != dst`

# Results
## constrained shortest path: max edges traversed
- this problem is just:
	- 'find min weight path given cap on edges'
	- and so: use a bellman-ford variant
