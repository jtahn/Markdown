[380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)

```python
class RandomizedSet:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        


# Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RandomizedSet()
# param_1 = obj.insert(val)
# param_2 = obj.remove(val)
# param_3 = obj.getRandom()
```

# Description

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

- `RandomizedSet()` Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
- `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
- `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in **average** `O(1)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**  
```
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
```
**Output:** `[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]`  
**Explanation:**  
```
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.
```

**Constraints:**
- `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`
- At most `2 *` `10^5` calls will be made to `insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom`.
- There will be **at least one** element in the data structure when `getRandom` is called.

# todo

#/move 
- i have no clue where this problem should belong
- g75 puts it in hashing…doesn’t make sense imo, bc its just as much about arrays and the ‘random’ function
	- imo this problem is more about understanding structures + using the standard library

#/fundy 
- find more 'STL' type problems for python
	- seems they're common fundy type for c++..ie testing how well you know the standard stuff
	- and #/jargon is 'STL'...so maybe just keep using this jargon for python?

#/fundy 
- this is a very nice problem imo, try to find more like this
- basically:
	- understand limitations/subtleties of the IMPLEMENTATIONS of these data structures in your chosen language
		- i suspect this is tightly related to the ‘interface’ (ie the only expected methods) for the ‘abstract’ versions of these data structures (ie, how they’re defined in a textbook, for any language)
		- ie any extra methods that your implementation/language provides outside of the ‘standard interface’, might not have reliable behavior
			- so you need to verify whether the extra methods are doing what you actually want them to do	

- this variant might be worth doing

	- hashset = python set

## python: use list for random access out of a mutable collection
- important observations:
	- random.choice only works on sequences
	- set.pop() is arbitrary, NOT random 
- and likely, similar stuff happens in any other language:
	- ie the ‘standard library function that randomly picks an object out of a container, only works on containers of a sequence type’
- so what this means is:
	- if you want to randomly pick an item out of a container:
		- the container needs to be a sequence
	- if you need this ‘random’ operation to be efficient:
		- then you should maintain these sequence at all times, instead of having to cast your container to a sequence every time you want to call random
	- if your container that you maintain is mutable:
		- then you should use list instead of tuple





## array: swap and pop
- contiguous array after deletion
- if order of elts in the array does not matter:
- to delete an element in O(1) time and still have ‘contiguous’ array:
	- ‘swap and pop’
- aka avoid shifting elements over
- we want contiguous array bc:
	- otherwise array just keeps growing every time we add, even if we’ve deleted
	- makes picking ‘random elt’ a lot more

## use hashmap to add efficient ops to an array
- #/jargon check clrs, i suspect this is ‘augmenting a data structure’
- define hashmap: (elt, index)
- hashmap:
	- efficient duplicate checks
	- efficiently determine where to find/remove an elt

## array + random + hash

```python
from random import choice


class RandomizedSet:

    def __init__(self):
        self.dict = {}
        self.list = []

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val in self.dict:
            return False

        self.dict[val] = len(self.list)
        self.list.append(val)

        return True

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val not in self.dict:
            return False

        idx, last_element = self.dict[val], self.list[-1]
        self.list[idx], self.dict[last_element] = last_element, idx
        self.list.pop()
        del self.dict[val]

        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return choice(self.list)
