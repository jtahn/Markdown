[328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151558.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,3,5,2,4]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426151607.png)  
**Input:** `head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]`  
**Output:** `[2,3,6,7,1,5,4]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`

## #linked_lists/pointers 
- think about what pointers you need
	- common types:
		- 'iterators'
			- that help you do operations during every iteration
		- 'global storage'
			- for nodes where you do something only 'once'

#/induction 
- i'm looking for inspo to how you 'realize' that you should have a separate iterator for the odd and even lists
- maybe: 
	- identifying common 'subroutines'
		- 'grouping' certain nodes together
			- for each group, build a list out of these nodes
			- then concat the groups
	- pointer types for each subroutine
		- building a list = need an iterator
		- concat groups = need global storage for head (and possibly tail) of each group


- here
	- iterators for building odd, even lists
	- 'global' storage for head of even list
		- bc final step: need to append to end of odd list

	- maybe: should also have iterator for 'where we are in the global list'
		- cuz this tbh, it's kind of an 'optimization' that the 'even' iterator can also serve this purpose

## linked list concepts


- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space


```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        if head is None:
            return None
      
        odd = head
        even = even_head = head.next
      
        while even and even.next:
	        odd2, even2 = even.next, even.next.next
            odd.next, even.next = odd2, even2
            odd, even = odd2, even2
             
        odd.next = even_head      
        return head
```
