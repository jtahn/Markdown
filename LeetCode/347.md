https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.



**Example 1:**
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2`
**Output:** `[1,2]`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [1], k = 1`
**Output:** `[1]`



**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

# Overview
- strategy  
	- compute and store counts   
		- Counter   
		- dictionary   
		- can't use an array, there's no bounds on what the entries could be   
	- then determine elements corresp to k most frequent counts   
		- bucket sort   
		- build max heap, pop k times   
		- build and stream through a size-k min heap   
		- quick select  
- python tips  
	- be aware of:    
		- Counter.most_common()   
		- heapq.nlargest()  
	- for max heap: need to invert the counts, bc heapq module implements a min heap

## Bucket sort
```
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
        for n, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(n)

        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res
```

- seems like best complexity 
- probly isn't viable in 'similar problems' (i.e. k closest distances)
	- bc in those problems, we don't have a bound/finite set of values
		- versus here we do: we know counts can only fall among n distinct values, where n is max size of array)
	- also the other problems, it's efficient/easy to compute the keys on the fly, so it makes sense to just try to sort in place
		- versus here, we need to compute the keys (aka counts) ahead of time, and makes zero sense to compute on the fly

## Min heap

python: better: use heappushpop:

## Quick select
