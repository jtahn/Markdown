Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.




**Example 1:**
**Input:** 
```
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:** `true`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** 
```
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.




**Constraints:**
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

# brute force
- strategy
	- for each cell
		- check the row, column, and box for a repeat
- complexity (n is a side length) (note n is also size of box)
	- O(n^3) time
		- for each cell (count n^2), we check row/column/box (count 3n)
	- O(1) space

- intuition
	- use memoization/structures so that the 'check a node's row/column/box for repeat' can be done in O(1) time instead of O(n)
		- ie dont naively check by iterating through 3n entries (the row, column, box)
		- idea
			- suppose node `(i,j)` contains `num`
			- then we want a data structure `row` so that `row[i][num]` tells us if `num` has already been found in the `i^th` row
			- and similarly have data structures `col` and `sub` (ie for the 3x3 subgrids/boxes)
			- observe each structure is size O(n^2)
		- intuition, aka why we should think of this?
			- we only care about existence/membership, and storing existence/membership/encounter is easy
			- it simple to hash/index all of the variables `i,j,num`
- what data structure?
	- hashing
		- dict of sets
		- list of sets
	- list of lists
		- if this problem generalized to much larger size, then maybe don't use this if your puzzles are generally sparse
		- NOTE: valid numbers are 1-9; and in the board are strings; this means that the corresponding index is `int(num)-1`
	- note: list of sets/lists means that you will need to think of a single number to index the subgrids
		- the typical choice here is `i//3 * 3  + j//3`
		- versus for dict of sets, can just use `(i//3, j//3)` as a key
	- bitmasking/bit manipulation
- for each nonempty cell
	- check for collisions
		- hashing: test for membership in
			- `row[i]`
			- `col[j]`
			- for subgrid/squares:
				- for dict of sets, `sub[(i//3, j//3)]`
				- for list of sets, `sub[i//3 * 3 + j//3]`
		- 2d list: check if any evaluate to `true`
			- `row[i][num]`
			- `col[j][num]`
			- `sub[i//3 * 3  + j//3][num]`
	- if no collisions, then mark it in the structure. ie:
		- set: add it to the set
		- 2d list: change the bools to `true`
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
		- iterate over entire board; checks/updates are O(1)
	- O(n^2) space
		- some ppl will say O(1) bc sudoku is fixed 9x9..idk this isn't reasonable imo, bc same argument says that time complexity is O(1)

## optimization: bitmasking 
- reduce space complexity bc we only care about existence
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- space
		- i don't think it's O(n), but i don't think it's O(n^2) either
		- actually might essentially be O(n)
			- we have 3 structures that each contain n 'bitmasks'
			- my issue is that: the 'size' of the 'bitmask' also depends on 'n'; ie i doubt you can assume each 'bitmask' is constant size
				- ie the 'bitmask' is n bits long...idk how this translates into  high level space complexity tho, i'm not familiar with bits/etc
		- its probably like O(nlogn) or something; ie the bitmask is size logn

# 'efficient AND lazy lookups'
- idea
	- with clever encodign/memoization, we only need a single set
	- previously, we used 3 structures to track of encountered numbers. and we used them via:
		- checking `row[i]` for `num`, or checking `row[i][num]` for `true`, you do:
	 - now instead: use one hashset `s` for everything, using an encoding:
		- check `s` for an encoding involving `row,i,num`
			- literally could just use the string `"row i num"` as the key
- strategy
	- initialize an empty set `seen`
	- for each `num = board[i][j]`
		- you test if the following strings exist in `seen`
			- `"num row i"`
			- `"num col j"`
			- `"num block k"`
		- if no collisions, then add them to the set
- the encoding
	- the "encoding" needs to make sure "different types of memoization elements are being constructed" for the row/col/blocks; ie so that "row elements" never "interfere" with "col elements", and etc etc
	- another example:
		- let `num = board[i][j]`
		- observe `num` is a string, not an integer
		- so the following tuples never "interfere"
			- `(num,i)` because it's `(string, int)`
			- `(j,num)` because it's `(int, string)`
			- `(num, i//3, j//3)` because it's size 3

another example encoding

- another way to check for collisions:
	- instead of a set; instead initialize a list `seen`
	- iterate through nodes and add everything to a list `seen`
	- then at the end do `return len(set(seen) == len(seen)`


![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226165724.png)



- language tip
	- should be able to simultaneously "add to set" and "test for membership" at the same time
	- ie `s.add(x)` should also return a bool telling me if it alrdy existed or not

ie java example:

# logn space
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time?
		- for each row (count n)
			- check duplicates..probly takes linear time
			- so ttl is O(n^2)
		- do same thing for cols, then blocks
	- O(logn) space
		- claimed
		- if this is true, then this is asymptotically the best method
			- but keep in mind: the constant for the time complexity is surely worse than the other methods; bc its like 3n^2, bc he loops through the puzzle 3 times
				- the other methods it should be just n^2
- below is a more unreadable/complicated example
	- btw according to realpython, map/zip are falling out of favor now..try to use generator expressions and comprehensions...
- me trying to figure out his jargon:
	- "using zip to transpose": ie so that rows of the transpose are columns of og puzzle
	- "generator to yield blocks": to check each 3x3 block
	- "bit memoization to check for unique digits":
		- go understand the `map()`
		- the `>>` is incrementing a bit
		- the `&` is some kind of boolean op, i forget...
