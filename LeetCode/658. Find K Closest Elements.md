[658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        
```

# Description

Given a **sorted** integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

- `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
- `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,4]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3,4]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= arr.length`
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
- `arr` is sorted in **ascending** order.
- `-10^4 <= arr[i], x <= 10^4`

# todo

#/move 
- seems like this is a ‘binary search’ problem

#/fundy 
- feels like i should really go ham on doing as many binary search problems as possible
	- iirc, it’s a very common topic among many top companies
	- there’s probly tons of ‘adhoc/tricky/patterns’:
		- this problem [[658. Find K Closest Elements]] is a good example where:
			- it’s optimal
			- it’s actually not obvious at all that we can use it
	- also everyone’s always saying how sorting+searching is so fundamental to so many problems you encounter both theoretically and irl



- as usual: i should emphasize that any time i'm asked to 'find something in sorted array':
	- i should immediately wonder if a binary search approach will work
	- this problem is an example where:
		- the 'something' is a fixed-sized window
	- so #/fundy , figure out all possible/typical 'somethings' in binary search problems
		- and also, all important 'ways' to handle these 'somethings'
			- ie here, we handled 'fixed-sized window' via binary search on start points
			- ie 'ways' = what specifically do we run binary search on
		- and also, if there are very standard tricks for the above
			- ie based on what we saw here: i'm sure that the standard trick for binary search on 'fixed sized window', is to apply #polya/ignore_intersection_when_comparing so that the comparison is super efficient


- there are a couple lessons/steps here:
	- binary search can be used to find things other than just 'one element in sorted array'
	- a 'polya' type lesson:
		- interpreting solution in a way that allows for a binary search pattern (aka interpreting it as a fixed size subarray)
	- if we want to find fixed-sized window:
		- maybe try binary search on the start of the window
		- you can likely write the conditions so that it only needs to compare the mid and mid+k elements
			- see #polya/ignore_intersection_when_comparing 



#/strats 
- (not urgent, bc i doubt it’s optimal)
	- check lc forums..apparently there’s a sliding window solution





# References

## #/tbd
- obvi, there is an underlying custom/induced sort function that we can define
- so then this problem is essentially asking ‘top k elements’
	- it isn’t ‘top k elements in sorted order’:
		- bc here, the desired output should not be sorted wrt the induced sort function
		- aka it’s not clear that ‘heap’ is the best thing to use here
			- (assuming that heap is consensus best approach for that problem)
				- btw if it is, then ‘top k elts in sorted order’ should become a fundy/tag, and i point out that heap is what you should use
				- ie see [[692. Top K Frequent Words]]
			- bc we lose the benefit of heap: that popping after streaming, gives us elements in order of the sort used to build the heap
- thus this problem really does have 2 separate steps:
	- select k, then sort k
	- (because the sort function used in these 2 steps, is different)


## #binary_search 
- #/jargon  check halim…should this be renamed to ‘bisection’?



## #polya/ignore_intersection_when_comparing

- if comparing two 'containers': then you only need to focus on where they differ
- important application: adjacent subarrays of fixed size: (ie #rolling )
	- then only difference is the first elt of left subarray, and last elt (right endpt) of right subarray
- this is basically like a practical/irl/implentation version of a 'polya' type idea:
	- 'ignore overlap when comparing things'




# Strategies


## custom sort then og/ascending sort
- strat
	- define a custom sort function (induced by ’distance/closer’ defined by problem)
	- sort/select top k wrt custom sort
		- (heap likely not necessarily the exclusive best approach here, see discussion above)
	- sort wrt og sort (aka ascending order)



## #binary_search 


```python
class Solution:
	def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
		left, right = 0, len(arr) - k
		while left < right:
			mid = (left + right) // 2
			# if mid is weakly closer
			if x - arr[mid] <= arr[mid+k] - x:
				right = mid
			# if mid+k is strictly closer
			else: 
				left = mid + 1
		return arr[left:left+k]
```

	- this is a really clever/subtle application of binary search imo
	- #/fundy i need to figure out the fundies here

- ideas
	- the `k` closest must form a consecutive subseq (ie contig subarray)
	- so binary search for the start of this subarray
- implementation
	- observe `right` starts at `len(arr)-k`, bc this is the furthest possible start point for a k-length subarray

- Check if `x` is closer to `arr[mid]` or to `arr[mid + k]`.
- If `x` is closer to `arr[mid]` or at the same distance to both, we discard the elements to the right of `mid + k` because the best starting point for our subsequence must be to the left or inclusive of `mid`.
- If `x` is closer to `arr[mid + k]`, we discard the elements to the left of `mid` since the best starting point must be to the right.




- correctness of binary search:
	- aka: how do we choose btwn `[left, mid]` and `[mid+1, right]`
	- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/solutions/106426/java-c-python-binary-search-o-log-n-k-k/comments/308767
		- If x - A[mid] > A[mid + k] - x, it means A[mid + 1] ~ A[mid + k] is better than A[mid] ~ A[mid + k - 1].
			- This means we compare below 2 windows to decided which window is 'better'. The only difference between these 2 windows are element A[mid] and A[mid + k], so we only need check who is closer to x, so its window would be 'better', i.e. all elements are closer to x compared to all elements in the other window.

	#/cleanup #/research 

	- what you’re then asking is:
		- should i pick range starting in left space or right space?
		- now: why is it enough to compare:
			- ’range starting at mid’ versus ‘range starting at mid+1’
			- and why does this comparison actually boil down to:
			- comparing mid and mid+k
			- ie, we do not actually use a value at mid+1
	- basically, need to realize: we are comparing windows
		- and in order to do this: the mid+1 window evaluation, we actually need to use its right endpoint
	
	- (using binary search ‘template’ jargon/structure)

	- why ‘weakly closer’
		- this is from how the problem defines ‘closer’
		- in case of equal distance: then tie goes to ascending order
	
	- why we compare mid with mid+k, instead of mid+1
		- i suspect this is actually necessary
	
	- (probly a ‘math’ property)
		- explain why the ‘weakly closer’ check can be done with a far more succinct inequality
			- ie doesn’t involve absolute values, and is just a one sided inequality for both mid and mid+k
