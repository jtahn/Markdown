[815. Bus Routes](https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/)

```python
class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], source: int, target: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i^th` bus repeats forever.

- For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0^th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> ...` forever.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (You are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return _the least number of buses you must take to travel from_ `source` _to_ `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `routes = [[1,2,7],[3,6,7]], source = 1, target = 6`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `routes = [[7,12],[4,5,15],[6],[15,19],[9,12,13]], source = 15, target = 12`  
**Output:** `-1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
- `1 <= routes[i].length <= 10^5`
- All the values of `routes[i]` are **unique**.
- `sum(routes[i].length) <= 10^5`
- `0 <= routes[i][j] < 10^6`
- `0 <= source, target < 10^6`

# todo

#/meta 

- imo/maybe: this problem [[815. Bus Routes]] is like [[310. Minimum Height Trees]]
	- in that: there is a strat that is very similar in 'core idea' to a 'named strat'
		- here: bellman-ford = "among 'related' estimates, use the 'best' one to 'improve' them"
		- there: kahn = "peeling and onion"
	- but the implementation/structure is noticeably different, to where i don't really think it should be considered a 'variant'
	- ie the inspo of the problem really just is, thinking of that very broad/core idea
		- NOT: 'think of the named strat' and then 'realize how to apply that strat here'
	- otoh: maybe this mean, for all of the named strats:
		- it's def worth trying trying to really understand the 'abstract core idea', bc then you can apply it to problems like this
- tbh, it feels like these are really good problems?
	- confirms whether you really understand core ideas behind the important algos
	- so even if some ideas are definitely worse on the general cases/structure:
		- there are times when something about the structure of your specific problem, makes that idea actually quite suitable and perform well
	- (so #/fundy ...find more problems like these?)
		- i suspect...no one really has a list for this...i'll just have to keep an eye out as i keep doing problems
		- aka keep doing problems, and always check submission percentiles
			- (no need to check forums...bc i'm only interested in the weird situations where they perform 'optimally') (aka i'm not interested in someone doing a weird/nonstandard approach that doesn't even perform well)



#/strats 
- are the strats here kinda like prim's?
	- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/halim1.pdf#page=247|halim1, 4.3.3 Prim’s Algorithm]]


#/problems 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method
- 



#/strats 
- important thing to understand here is why the best strats are best time complexity?
	- nodes=stops + dict
		- why is nodes=routes so much worse? seems like it should be no difference, or even better?
	- bellman-ford
		- this one is confusing, bc iirc ppl said bellman-ford is lowkey inefficient for 'shortest distance'? so what's diff about this problem?



- !!! i suspect: the reason why the 'best strats' are best, is bc somehow they handle that test case that other algos do poorly at, unless u 'game the test cases' where you initialize bfs at target instead of source
	- so look here to think of why the best strats do best...what about the structures/strat allows it to handle this kind of case very well?
	- iirc it was an absolutely massive problem, with lots of possible starting routes
		- but the 'target' only had 1 route (i suspect this isn't the part that actaully matters)



- !!!oh actually: just look at constraints
	- at most 500 routes
	- but essentially up to 10^5 stops
- hard part: so how does this help realize that 'nodes=routes' is worse complexity
	- bc tbh: kinda naively seems like, should be better bc 'less nodes'?
- maybe:
	- is it more efficient do deal with:
		- less nodes but high connectivity
		- lots of nodes but sparse?
	- ehh this q is too vague...depends a lot on your data structures as well...






- btw: need to use dict (and not array) for 'stop to routes'
	- bc no guarantee that stops are contiguous range
	- both examples actually directly show this







- the nodes=routes is easiest to understand imo...most intuitive
	- only issue is understanding 'how' to do it
- then it's kinda also clear how to do nodes=stops
	- only issue is there's like a bit more 'conditions' you need to do.?


#/meta 
- obsidian shortcuts:
	- `ctrl + tab` and `ctrl + tab + shift`





#/meta
- careful with leetcode top solutions
	- sometimes, it's because the test cases are not comprehensive, so code that isn't necessarily better, just happens to run a lot faster
	- example:
		- [[815. Bus Routes]]
			- the 'nodes=routes' strats: if you initialize the bfs on routes containing target (instead of source): you immediately jump to 99pct time complexity 




#/meta 
- when trying to figure out strat from the code:
	- first look at the 'main' data structures
		- then the 'aux' data structures
	- probly over time, i get a feel for: given a collection of data structures, which ones are probly the 'main' ones that will help indicate the strat
		- ie: if there's a stack/queue, then that's probly the main one?
- examples
	- [[815. Bus Routes]]
		- look at queue to immediately see if it's 'nodes=routes' or 'nodes=stops'


#/code #/style
- when naming vars, which is better?
	- option 1: really descriptive var names
	- option 2: var names that are basically identical to the 'abstract templates' you see in textbooks
- imo i prefer the latter if possible:
	- the 'descriptive names' kind of clutter/hide what the real structure of the problem is
	- and part of the whole point of graph problems is to figure out the abstract model/structure is anyways...
		- so just explain this briefly before the code
		- and then now it's easy to see why the code is correct, despite non-descriptive names
- btw, i bet this applies to other types of problems too...
	- aka for dp strats...always name the array `dp`
- for bfs:
	- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/halim1.pdf#page=227|halim1, 4.2.3 Breadth First Search (BFS)]]
		- queue, node, neighbor: q, u, v
	- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/halim1.pdf#page=229|halim1, 4.2.5 Flood Fill (Implicit 2D Grid Graph)]]
		- ans, r, c, dr, dc


- what are best-practice names for dictionaries?
	- and other structure too

#/problems 
- graph problems that practice the best way to build adjacency lists for a variety of inputs
	- (ie where adjacency list is actually required)
	- i want the 'hard part' of the problem being, how to build the adjacency list optimally

	- do not build a standard explicit representation!
	- just immediately jump into doing the traversal


- idk whether this is 'implicit' or 'uncommon explicit'
- the provided input is 'for each node, a list of indices of adjacent edges'
	- it seems most similar to incidence matrices, but it's not the same
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix


- imo one of the biggest lessons from this problem is:
	- building a graph structure can be expensive relative to the rest of your problem
	- so consider whether you even need to build it
		- efficiently building a graph structure...would it require 'aux' structures?
		- are those 'aux' structure actually sufficient to efficiently perform 'the main routine' on the graph?
		- possibly big/main example: if 'main routine' is just a traversal
	- what are the best 'aux structures'?

## #graphs/model 
- model 1: undirected graph
	- vertex = bus route
	- edge = routes intersect; ie buses share a common stop
	- strat: 
		- bfs shortest path
			- init bfs queue with all routes that contain our source
			- return when we find a route that contains target
				- return depth of the bfs

		- basically advises:
			- use bfs if unweighted
			- use dijkstra if non-negative weights
			- aka don't use b-f unless you absolutely have to (aka negative weights)




## #graphs/traversal 
- you need to immediately populate the visited set on queueing
	- you cannot wait until you 'process' the node
	- otherwise you might add a bunch of duplicates to the queue


# Strategies


## complexity

apparently for the nodes=routes/stops,


- time
	- O(M^2 K)
		- To store the routes for each stop we iterate over each route and for each route, we iterate over each stop, hence this step will take O(MK)
		- In the BFS, we iterate over each route in the queue. For each route we popped, we will iterate over its stop, and for each stop, we will iterate over the connected routes in the dict, hence the time required will be O(MKM)
	- O(nm + n^2)
		- n=routes, m = stops
		- doocs says this
		- they create the adjacency list, so that's probly why?
- space
	- O(MK)
		- 
		- the map adjList will store the routes for each stop. There can be MK number of stops in routes in the worst case (each of the M routes can have K stops), possibly with duplicates. When represented using adjList, each of the mentioned stops appears exactly once. Therefore, adjList contains an equal number of stop-route element pairs.


## nodes=routes; bfs

- the subtle/difficulty here is understanding what structures you actually need
	- poor choices here lead to 10x more inefficient code

- bfs simply means:
	- we want a way that is overall efficient to find neighbors
	- note: for each node, we only have to find neighbors once
		- so it doesn't make sense to have structures that are so expensive to build, that they override any efficiency gains when we actually use them

- neighbors: buses share a common stop


- edge = routes intersect; ie routes share a common stop
	- so actually, the best thing to do here is:
		- iterate through that routes stops
		- find what unvisited routes have those (unvisited) stops
			- via dict: stops to routes
- don't need anything else!
	- ie no need to convert routes into sets


- #/fundy i should understand exactly why we don't need a graph representation here
	- iirc there was another problem too, where: didn't need a graph rep...and that problem too, the algo was essentially just, 'do a traversal'

- i think here:
	- if you create a structure to make it more efficient to build the graph representation
	- then you can probly just directly use that structure to efficiently find neighbors
		- and if all you need to do is a traversal, then no need for graph rep


to find if routes contain a common stop: you're going to need some kind of hashing with stops being keys:
- 2 choices:
	- turn routes into a set
		- so stops are the key in each route
	- dict of stop to routes
- actually: both are same complexity?
	- same time bc have to iterate through all routes
	- and same space bc each structure is exactly all the (route,stop) pairs

- i think point is: both are same cost to build
	- and the second one is far more useful for finding neighbors in our situation:
		- for every route: in linear time can scan its stops and find its neighbors
		- cant do better than that



- deciding if there is an edge btwn 2 routes:
	- need to be able to quickly determine if a stop is inside a route
...
blegh idk how to explain this..imo just 'do it'

is it worth keeping what 'not' to do?

## nodes = stops; "bellman-ford"
- refs
	- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/halim1.pdf#page=264|halim1, 4.4.4 On Small Graph (with Negative Cycle): Bellman-Ford]]
- base bf ideas is vaguely simple
	- each time you relax ALL edges, then any nodes connected to 'nodes that alrdy have correct distance' will now have correct distance
		- (so that's why: need to relax up to V-1 times)
	- there's a lot of handwaving here, which is why all the authors shove proofs of correctness to other parts of their book


- jargon: relaxation
	- [[../_secondary/02 algorithms/clrs.pdf#page=631&selection=210,0,210,10|clrs, page 631]]
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(approximation)




- btw this isn't actually bellman-ford..it's a modified idea...
	- it's still same 'worst case complexity', bc we every 'iteration', we iterate through ALL node-edge incidences
		- aka iterate through all edges


- inspo:
	- suppose we have estimates of all the stops' distances from source
	- if a stop along a route has estimate `k`; then all other stops along that route can be updated to `k+1`
	- similarly:
		- the first pass through all the routes, will give us correct estimate for all stops that are distance 1 from source
		- the second pass will give us distance 2...etc etc
- strat
	- 'relaxation'; repeatedly iterate through routes and 'relax' stops distances
		- for each route:
			- go through it's stops to determine min stop on the route
			- then go through it's stops again and relax values



- b-f is typically slower...so why does it work so well here?
	- as before, we don't have to waste time building a graph representation
	- maybe/imo: the 'core idea' here kinda seems like it in practice allows for very rapid convergence
		- in typical b-f, seems you only relax along an edge
		- but here: it's like we relax a ton of nodes simultaneously, via whatever node has the best estimate along this route
