[588. Design In-Memory File System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system)

```python
class FileSystem:
    def __init__(self):
	    

    def ls(self, path: str) -> List[str]:
	    

    def mkdir(self, path: str) -> None:
        

    def addContentToFile(self, filePath: str, content: str) -> None:
        

    def readContentFromFile(self, filePath: str) -> str:
        


# Your FileSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = FileSystem()
# param_1 = obj.ls(path)
# obj.mkdir(path)
# obj.addContentToFile(filePath,content)
# param_4 = obj.readContentFromFile(filePath)
```

# Description

Design a data structure that simulates an in-memory file system.

Implement the FileSystem class:
- `FileSystem()` Initializes the object of the system.
- `List<String> ls(String path)`
	- If `path` is a file path, returns a list that only contains this file's name.
    - If `path` is a directory path, returns the list of file and directory names **in this directory**. The answer should be in **lexicographic order**.
- `void mkdir(String path)` Makes a new directory according to the given `path`. The given directory path does not exist. If the middle directories in the path do not exist, you should create them as well.
- `void addContentToFile(String filePath, String content)`
    - If `filePath` does not exist, creates that file containing given `content`.
    - If `filePath` already exists, appends the given `content` to original content.
- `String readContentFromFile(String filePath)` Returns the content in the file at `filePath`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**
```
["FileSystem", "ls", "mkdir", "addContentToFile", "ls", "readContentFromFile"]
[[], ["/"], ["/a/b/c"], ["/a/b/c/d", "hello"], ["/"], ["/a/b/c/d"]]
```
**Output:** `[null, [], null, null, ["a"], "hello"]`  
**Explanation:**
```
FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();
fileSystem.ls("/"); // return []
fileSystem.mkdir("/a/b/c");
fileSystem.addContentToFile("/a/b/c/d", "hello");
fileSystem.ls("/"); // return ["a"]
fileSystem.readContentFromFile("/a/b/c/d"); // return "hello"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= path.length, filePath.length <= 100`
- `path` and `filePath` are absolute paths which begin with `'/'` and do not end with `'/'` except that the path is just `"/"`.
- You can assume that all directory names and file names only contain lowercase letters, and the same names will not exist in the same directory.
- You can assume that all operations will be passed valid parameters, and users will not attempt to retrieve file content or list a directory or file that does not exist.
- `1 <= content.length <= 50`
- At most `300` calls will be made to `ls`, `mkdir`, `addContentToFile`, and `readContentFromFile`.

## #trie

- btw: trie = prefix tree
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie

- here
	- nodes = 'base' name
		- could be folder or file
		- find the #/jargon here
	- terminal node:
		- indicates a file
	- path to a node:
		- the full path of that folder or file

- so then it becomes 'obvious' how to implement FileSystem via trie ops
	- `ls`
		- traverse trie to the corresp node
		- if terminal node: then it's a file, so print the singleton list
		- else, it's a directory: so print a list of direct child terminal nodes
			- btw #/jargon for TREE treversal:
				- child is probably 'direct descendant'
			- children only, bc we only want files in this directory
			- remember lexicographic order
	- `mkdir`
		- traverse trie
			- insert 'normal' nodes as needed
	- `addContent`
		- traverse trie
			- except last node: insert 'normal' nodes as needed
			- last node: insert 'terminal' node if dne
		- handling content:
			- so terminal nodes need to also have an 'attribute'/'element' that stores 'content'
				- #/jargon ?
					- ie a container that also has a 'content' element
					- or 'object' that has 'content' attribute
				- what type of structure should content be?
					- list: then append on add; return the join on read
					- string: append/concat on add; return on read
						- in java, you should use 'stringbuilder' instead of 'string' bc 'string' is immutable...aka memory efficiency optimization
						- does python have something similar? cuz str immutable in python as well
					- (does it matter what you choose here?)
	- `readContent`
		- traverse trie
		- access the terminal node's "content" attribute/element

- how to store children?
	- the key operations here:
		- traversal
		- printing terminal children in lexicographic order
	- options:
		- list:
			- so then: efficiently insert stuff in lexicographic order
				- ie via binary search
			- but then then traversing isn't O(1)
		- dict
			- traversing is O(1)
			- printing 
	- iirc, dict is likely standard when the children dont map easily to a bounded range
		- ie when storing strings in a trie, could use an array bc its just 26 possible children
	- list only seems reasonable/better if you have all of:
		- expect far more `ls` operations
		- not many traversals (this seems unreasonable)
		- probly some other considerations...yea regardless, list seems silly...but maybe i should really clearly understand all the tradeoffs here, and the scenarios where list would ever be beter
		- (not urgent)


- everyone seems to do:
	- content: use list
	- links to children: use dict


- var names
	- terminal flag = 'isfile' flag


- btw remember: seems standard/basic way to implement trie:
	- the class is really just a node
	- aka the Trie class is a node; it's NOT the 'whole structure'
	- and just use 'linked list' concepts to traverse the trie
		- so the excplicit 'var' you store for the trie, is really just the root
- check skiena/etc:
	- is it standard to call the class `Trie` or `TrieNode`


- jargon
	- the file system traverses the Trie based on the path segments
	- 'boolean flag'


# Strategies



## trie
- complexity
	- The time complexity is primarily `O(N)` for the majority of operations, where `N` is the depth of the directory or the number of elements in the path.
	- The space used is proportional to the number of unique paths and the content inside files. Therefore, it's `O(U + C)`, where `U` is the total number of unique paths and `C` is the total content size.


```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        self.isFile = False
        self.content = []
        self.children = {}

    def insert(self, path, isFile):
        node = self
        ps = path.split('/')
        for p in ps[1:]:
            if p not in node.children:
                node.children[p] = Trie()
            node = node.children[p]
        node.isFile = isFile
        if isFile:
            node.name = ps[-1]
        return node

    def search(self, path):
        node = self
        if path == '/':
            return node
        ps = path.split('/')
        for p in ps[1:]:
            if p not in node.children:
                return None
            node = node.children[p]
        return node


class FileSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = Trie()

    def ls(self, path: str) -> List[str]:
        node = self.root.search(path)
        if node is None:
            return []
        if node.isFile:
            return [node.name]
        return sorted(node.children.keys())

    def mkdir(self, path: str) -> None:
        self.root.insert(path, False)

    def addContentToFile(self, filePath: str, content: str) -> None:
        node = self.root.insert(filePath, True)
        node.content.append(content)

    def readContentFromFile(self, filePath: str) -> str:
        node = self.root.search(filePath)
        return ''.join(node.content)

### Time Complexity

- For the `insert` method:
    
    - The time complexity is `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the path (number of directories in the path). Since the path is split into parts and there is a check and potentially an insertion for each part, the time taken is linear w.r.t the number of parts.
- For the `search` method:
    
    - Similarly, the time complexity is `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the path. This is because the operation has to potentially traverse that many nodes in the worst-case scenario to find if the path exists in the trie.
- For the `ls` method:
    
    - The time complexity is `O(m + nlogn)` where `m` is the length of the path and `n` is the number of entries (files and directories) in the final directory. This is because it takes `O(m)` time to search the node and `O(nlogn)` to sort the keys if it is a directory. If it's a file, it returns immediately, and thus the complexity would be `O(m)`.
- For the `mkdir` method:
    
    - This calls the `insert` method with `isFile` set to `False`, and thus it has the same complexity as `insert`, which is `O(m)`.
- For the `addContentToFile` method:
    
    - This method calls `insert` which takes `O(m)` time, and appends content to the file. The append operation can be considered as `O(1)` given that Python lists are dynamic arrays. So, the total time complexity is `O(m)`.
- For the `readContentFromFile` method:
    
    - This involves searching the file node which takes `O(m)` and then concatenating the content which takes `O(k)` where `k` is the total length of the content. Thus the time complexity is `O(m + k)`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of both the Trie and FileSystem is related to the number of unique paths stored and the total content.
    
- For the `Trie` class:
    
    - The space complexity is based on the number of nodes and content of the files. In the worst case, if all paths are unique with no common prefixes, and the paths are of length `m`, the space complexity would be `O(nm)` where `n` is the number of unique paths.
- For content storage:
    
    - The total space taken is the sum of the space for storing the content for all files, which can be considered as `O(t)` where `t` is the total length of the content across all files.
- Overall, the combined space complexity for the Trie structure and file content storage is `O(nm + t)`.
