[518. Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** there are four ways to make up the amount:  
```
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `amount = 3, coins = [2]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `amount = 10, coins = [10]`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of `coins` are **unique**.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`

#/todo 
- cite/backlink [[377. Combination Sum IV]]
	- apparently only diff:
		- that problem is permutations; this problem is combinations
		- and so it changes order of loops
	- i think this is [[../_refs/algorithms/epi.pdf#page=334&offset=-115,397,0|epi, 17.10 Count the number of moves to climb stairs]]

	- don't try to make connections to knapsack rn
	- i think it'll be far easier to do this once i actually solve/look at implementations of knapsack algos
	- aka go find leetcode problems of the knapsack variants



#/move
- bottom-up isn't always faster?
	- [[_refs/edu/cmu/15-451/lecture09-dp1.pdf#page=12&selection=2,0,7,39|lecture09-dp1, page 12]]
		- though do they mean...on specific input choices?
		- or are there actually problems where for arbitrary/general input, top-down is faster?

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Definition
	- trad knapsack wants to optimize/maximize a value
	- change-making problem is a (special) case
		- i'm not entirely clear why?
			- what is `v_i` for change-making...
			- ie which knapsack problem is it?
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem#Related_problems
			- the description here doesn't have any `v_i`..almost like they replace it with `x_i`
			- aka [[322. Coin Change]]
			- basically: 'hit the value' becomes a constraint
			- coin values are weights
			- and now we minimize num coins
	- the current problem 518 is the 'coin change problem' and that wiki article says its a 'general case of partition' problem
		- no wiki article for 'coin change'


- #\todo understand the relationship btwn coin problems and knapsack
	- (esp for this problem, seems harder)





# Results



## #/tbd 



### defining subproblems
- remember that subproblems should have same structure as og problem
	- ie same 'input parameters' and 'return variable' 
	- ie `f(x) = y` is how we define a 'general' problem
		- and our solution is just the 'maximal' input(s) x
		- and subproblems are just subsets/smaller x
	- it is immediate/obvious to figure out what the 'return variable' should be, aka `y`
		- i suspect much of the difficulty will be in:
			- figuring what inputs/params x to use
			- how later subproblems can be solved from solutions to smaller subproblems
				- i suspect: for harder problems, there's many ways; but one of them is 'best'.aka see next 2 points
			- what order we should solve subproblems
				- bc some orders can lead to efficiency, see below
			- what subproblem solns we actually need to save (which is intertwined with above point) to solve future subproblems


- compare with [[322. Coin Change]]
	- other than 'use dp', the strats aren't very similar
	- different subproblems
		- 322 does `f(amt) = min num coins needed`
			- you could also try: `f(denom subset, amt)`
			- but basically you realize you don't need the 'denom subset' input:
				- problems can be solved from subproblems that use same subset
				- which mean there's no need to solve the smaller subset subproblems
				- just skip straight to the 'full set' subproblems
			- i think it's good to mention this; bc makes it clear why this problem truly is a '2d' problem
				- bc subproblems depend on stuff across multiple axes
		- here we have `f(denomination subset, amt) = num ways to hit amt`
			- 

### 2d optimization: 1d storage

- 2d dp optimization here:
	- we will need to fill out the 2d 'table of subproblem solutions'
	- question: what order should be do it?
	- realize:
		- can do it 1d at a time, and only need 1d space
	- compared to other previous problems where i saw this type of optimization:
		- i think this problem, it DOES matter which axes you choose to iterate over
		- ie iterating certain axes will have better complexity (not just better constant; but better asymptotics?)



- i suspect:
	- general strat:
		- fix a subproblem
		- there are probly multiple/certain ways you can generate a solution from smaller subproblems
		- each way forces a certain order of iteration and amt of storage
		- so pick the way with best storage
	- here:
		- (i bet if you draw a 2d table, it becomes really obvious)
			- yea see starting around 9:00
				- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjy4hd2xgrs&list=PLPe9IkX86X3y5m_MvtNu2ughxsvkqUNKr&index=115
			- !!!!oh actually, i think there's just one way:
				- it's same as other simpler 2d problems
				- soln computed from soln directly 'below' along each axis
					- along 'subsets' axes: 
						- use/add soln with the next smaller subset
						- (aka hit amt without using this coin)
					- along 'amt' axes:
						- use/add soln at amt-currDenom
						- (aka hit amt while using this coin)
				- now: why its 'better' to have outer loop along coin denoms:
					- along 'increasing subsets' axes:
						- only need the previous index
							- which means we can use 1d, and 'update' and entry in place
								- structure is size:
									- numAmts x numPrevSubsetsToSave
									- aka: numAmts x 1
					- along 'amts' axes
						- size of denom is the num of previous 'amt' indices we need to save
							- so optimizing here:
								- probly means need a structure that is size:
									- numSubsets x  numPrevAmtsToSave
									- aka numDenoms x maxDenomSize
								- could do another mini optimization here, bc each row only needs that denom size (not max denom size)...but this starts becoming a headache to code imo
									- imo easiest way to explain this is actually via a diagram
									- optimal 'structure' here will be kinda like a triangle
										- [[../!assets/Excalidraw/triangle|triangle]]
											- ![[../!assets/attachments/Pasted image 20240507214344.png]]
					- !!! actually v2: in 2d: (i think this matches up with what i have above)
						- we need to save full axis for inner loop dimension, bc we restart along this axis every time
						- the size corresp to outer loop dimension: depends on how far back we need to see along this axis for an arbitrary subproblem
					- #/fundy i wonder if it's worth finding a fundy for a higher dim problem
						- so i can see how this fundy generalizes
		- results in optimal implementation:
			- outer loop: iterate over coin denominations
			- inner loop + only store: amts








### tbd
- (now i think this heading/discussion is incorrect/useless)

- big idea: taking care of 'redundant combos'
	- aka ensuring we're computing num combos and not num permutations
	- iterating through coin denoms on top loop
		- i don't think it matters what order you loop over the denoms
		- i'm p sure it matters that coin is top loop; this takes care of redundancy somehow
		- think about what happens/whether 'amts' can be top loop


### tbd

- idk if this is useful

- https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-differentiate-between-a-knapsack-problem-and-a-coin-exchange-problem
	- for multiple occurrences you run inner cycle over values in increasing order. That's the only difference between them. Why does it work? When you are considering DP[x] and trying to update it by adding value y, it affects DP[x+y]. When you run over values in decreasing order - you already visited DP[x+y] while proceeding given item. When you'll be looking at it next time - you'll be working with a different item already, therefore you can't take one item twice or more. On the other hand, if you have some configuration for DP[x], and take it when considering item with value y and running over possible costs in increasing order - you'll visit DP[x+y] later while still doing updates with given item, so you'll have an opportunity to take it one more time (leading to DP[x+2*y]), and then from DP[x+2*y] you may move to DP[x+3*y] - and so on
