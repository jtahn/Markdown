[409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "abccccdd"`  
**Output:** `7`  
**Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "a"`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.

- imo this is the way you can generalize the adhoc observation below?
- ie the application here is:
	- if you’re wondering if you can ‘create’ something:
		- think about which ‘required’ conditions are enough for you
			- aka ‘properties’
			- aka ‘weaker conditions’
		- the idea being: it’s probly easier/more efficient to compute ‘weaker’ conditions
		- ie you might have ‘freedom’ that allows you to ignore some ‘necessary’ conditions
- what is the #/jargon here btw? vaguely the related terms are:
	- sufficient = more than you need
	- necessary = exactly what you need


## #ad_hoc 
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/409
	- palindrome requires
		- every element (except center, if odd) needs to be paired
	- so this problem is really about tracking even and odd counts
		- and as we iterate: updating our solution as counts/parity changes
- is this adhoc or greedy?
	- solution does feel greedy, but it uses an observation sooo specialized that imo it should probly be classified as adhoc

		- _**Ad hoc**_ is a [Latin phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases "List of Latin phrases") meaning literally '**for this**'. In [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), it typically signifies a solution for a specific purpose, problem, or task rather than a [generalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization "Generalization") solution adaptable to collateral instances (compare with _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_).
