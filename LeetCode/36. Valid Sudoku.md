```

# Description
Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224212641.png)  
**Input:**  
```
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```  
**Output:** `true`    

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**  
```
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.  

**Constraints:**
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

	- only check collisions among visited items
	- we only need existence, so use a set
- bitmasking
	- turns O(n) into O(log n)
	- todo:
		- cite one of the future 'bit' problems on the needcode list, once i get there
		- and move the discussion here, to there
			- explanation
			- python implementation


# Results

## labeling/enumerating sub-blocks of a matrix
- standard approaches
	- `(i, j)`
	- `(i//3)*3 + j//3`


## 1 hashmap for all types of collisions
- if you have diff 'types' of collisions:
	- if ANY collision causes 'failure', then can just 1 hashmap for everything
		- versus a diff hashmap for each type of collision
		- to differentiate btwn diff 'types' of collisions: implementation:
			- tuple seems most standard/easiest

## 'intermediate' python hashing
- what containers can be hashed?
	- tuples
	- strings

## 1d space
- iterate collision types separately
	- instead of doing all of row, column, and sub-block at the same time:
		- you first check row collisions
		- then col collisions
		- then sub-box
- (todo) iirc time complexity is not only same asymptotics but also constant
- significant space complexity savings

## personal pref: compute complexity wrt 'spirit of the problem'
- what complexity do i pick for [36. Valid Sudoku](../LeetCode/36.%20Valid%20Sudoku.md)
	- see [complexity analysis wrt "spirit of the problem"](../Blurbs/complexity%20analysis%20wrt%20"spirit%20of%20the%20problem".md)
	- spirit of the problem results in trivial space complexity
	- the ‘arbitrary size sudoku’ variant makes the complexity analysis a lot more interesting...
	- (todo: figure out how i should do complexity analysis for sudoku)

- the spirit of the problem seems to be:
	- 1-9 really should be considered finite range
	- so, much of the space complexity should probably be O(1)
	- todo: for now, consider the grid size / valid number ‘range’ to be an arbitrary N
		- ie a sudoku where side lengths are N^2
		- so ‘true sudoku’ is where N=3
			- ie the ‘generating number’ is actually 3, not 9
- one way to see this: dims of sub-blocks are NxN 
	- if i find a new problem that is essentially the ‘arbitrary N’ version of the problem: then change sudoku to be O(1)
	- also see the relevant blurb/brownie points




# todo
- when editing this problem:
	- a lot of content/edits/adjustments can actually just be moved to 2sum


## to style
- maybe briefly list all the implementation variants for an approach
	- ie as a list right under the heading
		- in order of complexity (worst to best)
	- then have the code snippet with them all there



# Abstract


# Approaches
- only need 1 approach heading
	- then each code example has a brief comment of the fundies used
		- a 3d hashmap for each type of collision
			- ie 3 separate structures for row/col/sub-box
			- comments or mini prose about:
				- trick for indexing sub-boxes
				- casting btwn ints and string: remember starting at 0 or 1
		- 3d hashmap for all collisions
		- 1d hashmap
			- this should be O(n) space
		- 1d hashmap + bitmasking
			- seems this is what the 'claimed O(log n) space' is doing


## Brute force
- strategy
	- for each cell that has a digit
		- check if digit is repeated in the same row, column, and sub-box
- complexity
	- let n be the side length
		- note n is also size of sub-box
	- O(n^3) time
		- for each cell (count n^2)
			- we check for collisions in its row, column, and sub-box (3n entries to check)
	- O(1) space


## Collision checks on visited elements

- intuition
	- sacrifice space for time
	- it is sufficient to check for repeats among nodes that we have already iterated over
		- ie: still check if digit is repeated in the same row/column/sub-box, but only among nodes we've already iterated over
	- as we iterate, use memoization/structures so that these checks can be done in O(1) time instead of O(n)
		- ie dont naively check by iterating through 3n entries (the row, column, box)
		- idea
			- suppose node `(i,j)` contains `num`
			- then we want a structure `row` so that `row[i]` tells us if `num` has already been found in the `i^th` row
			- and similarly have data structures `col` and `sub`
		- intuition, aka why we should think of this?
			- we only care about existence/encountered, which is simple to store
			- it simple to hash/index the vars `i,j,num`
- what data structure?
	- hashing
		- dict of sets
		- list of sets
	- list of lists
		- if this problem generalized to much larger size, then maybe don't use this if your puzzles are generally sparse
- for each nonempty cell
	- check for collisions
		- hashing: check if `num` in
			- `row[i]`
			- `col[j]`
			- for sub-boxes:
				- for dict of sets, `sub[(i//3, j//3)]`
				- for list of sets, `sub[i//3 * 3 + j//3]`
					- note: we need to assign an index to the sub-boxes
					- the typical choice here is `i//3 * 3  + j//3`
					- versus for dict of sets, can just use `(i//3, j//3)` as a key
		- 2d list: check if any are storing `true`
			- `row[i][num]`
			- `col[j][num]`
			- `sub[i//3 * 3  + j//3][num]`
			- NOTE: valid numbers are 1-9; and in the board are strings; this means that the corresponding index for the inner list is actually `int(num)-1`
				- ie more precise to write: `row[i][int(num)-1]`
	- if no collisions, then mark it in the structure. ie:
		- set: add it to the set
		- 2d list: change the bool to `true`
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
		- iterate over entire board; checks/updates are O(1)
	- O(n^2) space
		- each structure `row,col,sub` is size O(n^2)
		- some ppl will say O(1) bc sudoku is fixed 9x9..idk this isn't reasonable imo, bc same argument says that time complexity is O(1)




### optimization: bitmasking 
- reduce space complexity bc we only care about existence
- so instead of a structure `row`, we use a "bitmask" `row` where bit `row[i]` is 0 or 1
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- space
		- i don't think it's O(n), but i don't think it's O(n^2) either
		- actually might essentially be O(n)
			- we have 3 structures that each contain n 'bitmasks'
			- my issue is that: the 'size' of the 'bitmask' also depends on 'n'; ie i doubt you can assume each 'bitmask' is constant size
				- ie the 'bitmask' is n bits long...idk how this translates into  high level space complexity tho, i'm not familiar with bits/etc
		- its probably like O(nlogn) or something; ie the bitmask is size logn

## "Efficient lookups" AND "Lazy storage"
- idea
	- with clever encodign/memoization, we only need a single set
	- previously, we used 3 structures to track of encountered numbers. and we used them via:
		- checking `row[i]` for `num`, or checking `row[i][num]` for `true`, you do:
	 - now instead: use one hashset `s` for everything, using an encoding:
		- check `s` for an encoding involving `row,i,num`
			- literally could just use the string `"row i num"` as the key
- strategy
	- initialize an empty set `seen`
	- for each `num = board[i][j]`
		- you test if the following strings exist in `seen`
			- `"num row i"`
			- `"num col j"`
			- `"num block k"`
		- if no collisions, then add them to the set
- the encoding
	- the "encoding" needs to make sure "different types of memoization elements are being constructed" for the row/col/blocks; ie so that "row elements" never "interfere" with "col elements", and etc etc
	- another example:
		- let `num = board[i][j]`
		- observe `num` is a string, not an integer
		- so the following tuples never "interfere"
			- `(num,i)` because it's `(string, int)`
			- `(j,num)` because it's `(int, string)`
			- `(num, i//3, j//3)` because it's size 3

another example encoding
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226163609.png)


- another way to check for collisions:
	- instead of a set; instead initialize a list `seen`
	- iterate through nodes and add everything to a list `seen`
	- then at the end do `return len(set(seen) == len(seen)`


![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240226165724.png)



- language tip
	- should be able to simultaneously "add to set" and "test for membership" at the same time
	- ie `s.add(x)` should also return a bool telling me if it alrdy existed or not

ie java example:

# todo: claimed logn space
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time?
		- for each row (count n)
			- check duplicates..probly takes linear time
			- so ttl is O(n^2)
		- do same thing for cols, then blocks
	- O(logn) space
		- claimed
		- if this is true, then this is asymptotically the best method
			- but keep in mind: the constant for the time complexity is surely worse than the other methods; bc its like 3n^2, bc he loops through the puzzle 3 times
				- the other methods it should be just n^2
- below is a more unreadable/complicated example
	- btw according to realpython, map/zip are falling out of favor now..try to use generator expressions and comprehensions...
- me trying to figure out his jargon:
	- "using zip to transpose": ie so that rows of the transpose are columns of og puzzle
	- "generator to yield blocks": to check each 3x3 block
	- "bit memoization to check for unique digits":
		- go understand the `map()`
		- the `>>` is incrementing a bit
		- the `&` is some kind of boolean op, i forget...
