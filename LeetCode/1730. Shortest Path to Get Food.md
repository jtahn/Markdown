[1730. Shortest Path to Get Food](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-to-get-food)

```python
class Solution:
    def getFood(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
	    
```

# Description

You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.

You are given an `m x n` character matrix, `grid`, of these different types of cells:

- `'*'` is your location. There is **exactly one** `'*'` cell.
- `'#'` is a food cell. There may be **multiple** food cells.
- `'O'` is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
- `'X'` is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.

You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there is not an obstacle.

Return _the **length** of the shortest path for you to reach **any** food cell_. If there is no path for you to reach food, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013211.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** It takes 3 steps to reach the food.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013223.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** It is not possible to reach the food.

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013233.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** There can be multiple food cells. It only takes 6 steps to reach the bottom food.

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `grid[row][col]` is `'*'`, `'X'`, `'O'`, or `'#'`.
- The `grid` contains **exactly one** `'*'`.

#/jargon 
- imo array needs to be split into:
	- interval and matrix
	- bc 1d and 2d are by far the most common patterns
	- and they have distinct patterns inside them

#/fundy 
- ??? (this was from andy's writeup..go look at his earlier 'shortest path' writeups)
	- https://medium.com/@andyangnyc/leetcode-1730-shortest-path-to-get-food-62e9856633c8#bypass
	- Besides that, we can record the status in the state, or we can have a separate variable. Either one works.


# References


## #graphs/traversal/bfs 
- shortest path? bfs
- structure? queue
- python queue? deque

## #matrix

- what is the standard for which dim is rows, adn which dim is cols?


## #array/traversal/neighbors 
- standard trick: 'directions'
	- could use `dirs = (-1, 0, 1, 0, -1)`
		- but then for loop is kinda annoying
		- or use itertools.pairwise, which is kinda golfy imo
			- `for dx, dy in pairwise(dirs):`
			- https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.pairwise
	- prefer `dirs = ((-1, 0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1))`
		- bc makes the for loop cleaner/easier
- standard trick:
	- visited array, or modify the array in-place

- clean code:
	- the process here seems very common, it'd be good to figure out some var names that i'll default to
	- as a math person...for matrix aka 2d array, i REALLY like:
		- x,y for current row/col
		- dx,dy for neighbor direction
		- fx,fy for neighbor row/col
	- see [[1730. Shortest Path to Get Food]]
		alternatively:
		r,c; dr,dc; nr,nc
		and for num rows/cols: N, C
		(aka global var is capital)



## #/tbd


- python surely has something similar to this snippet here
	- ie naming a conditional, for use later
	- seems optimally clean+readable
		- and something that could definitely come in handy in so many other situations, so it's worth having a #/fundy 
	- (and what is the #/jargon?)
		- imo: something like python/TBD/'var for conditional'? )
		- where TBD is like...'snippet' or 'clean code'

```js
  const isValid = (r, c) => r >= 0 && r < R && c >= 0 && c < C && grid[r][c] !== "X";

      for (const [dr, dc] of DIRS) {
        const nr = r + dr, nc = c + dc;
        if (isValid(nr, nc) && !visited[nr * C + nc]) {
          q.push([nr, nc]);
          visited[nr * C + nc] = true;
        }
      }
```




# Strategies

## bfs (compute/store steps)



- find start
- init bfs at start
- bfs:
	- append valid neighbors
		- in bounds
		- unvisited
		- no obstacle
	- return if food
- after bfs:
	- means impossible, bc no food is reachable (ie in this component)


```python
class Solution:
    def getFood(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        i, j = next((i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == '*')
		q = deque([(i, j)]) # start_row, start_col
        dirs = ((-1, 0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1))
        steps = 0
        while q:
            steps += 1
            for _ in range(len(q)):
				x, y = q.popleft()    
				for dx, dy in dirs:
					fx, fy = x + dx, y + dy
					if 0 <= fx < n and 0 <= fy < m:
						if grid[fx][fy] == '#':
							return steps
						if grid[fx][fy] == '0':
							grid[fx][fy] == 'X'
							q.append((fx, fy))
        return -1
```
