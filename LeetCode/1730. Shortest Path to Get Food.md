[1730. Shortest Path to Get Food](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-to-get-food)

```python
class Solution:
    def getFood(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
	    
```

# Description

You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.

You are given an `m x n` character matrix, `grid`, of these different types of cells:

- `'*'` is your location. There is **exactly one** `'*'` cell.
- `'#'` is a food cell. There may be **multiple** food cells.
- `'O'` is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
- `'X'` is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.

You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there is not an obstacle.

Return _the **length** of the shortest path for you to reach **any** food cell_. If there is no path for you to reach food, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013211.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** It takes 3 steps to reach the food.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013223.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** It is not possible to reach the food.

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420013233.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** There can be multiple food cells. It only takes 6 steps to reach the bottom food.

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `grid[row][col]` is `'*'`, `'X'`, `'O'`, or `'#'`.
- The `grid` contains **exactly one** `'*'`.

### Idea

1. After reading the description, you'll find this question is a bit similiar to this [question](https://medium.com/@andyangnyc/leetcode-1293-shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination-b60f229579f7).
2. The similarities are a) they both have obstacles, and b) we need to reach the "destination" from some "start".
3. The differences are a) we cannot remove obstacles here, and b) the "start" and "destination" are not already known, we need to find them.
4. Actually if you think about it, the differences are not that significant, why? Because a) we cannot remove obstacles here, and this only makes the question easier, since the "state" is fixed, b) we can easily find the "start", and the destination is just where the food stays (`'#'`).
5. OK, let's try to solve this problem.
6. Where to start? Let's find our start by traversing the grid.
7. How to proceed? BFS is still our best friend here. We follow the same pattern, try all possibilities from start and find "start"s for next round, until we find the destination (the food).
8. However, do we need to record if we visited a cell before?
9. That's a terrific question!
10. Because if you remember from this [question](https://medium.com/@andyangnyc/leetcode-1091-shortest-path-in-binary-matrix-e9119754ceb1), with similiar logic, we don't want to revisit a cell because it's gonna be a longer path than the previous one.
11. For recording the "visited" status, we can use the traditional way to have a separate array, or you can modify the original grid to mark the "visited" status, depending on your needs.
12. Besides that, we can record the status in the state, or we can have a separate variable. Either one works.
13. The code should explain itself.

### Solution

#### Javascript

```js
const getFood = function(grid) {
  const R = grid.length, C = grid[0].length;
  const DIRS = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
  const isValid = (r, c) => r >= 0 && r < R && c >= 0 && c < C && grid[r][c] !== "X";
  const [r, c] = findStart();
  const q = [[r, c]], visited = [];
  visited[r * C + c] = true;
  let steps = 0;
  while (q.length) {
    const len = q.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
      const [r, c] = q.shift();
      if (grid[r][c] == "#") return steps;

      for (const [dr, dc] of DIRS) {
        const nr = r + dr, nc = c + dc;
        if (isValid(nr, nc) && !visited[nr * C + nc]) {
          q.push([nr, nc]);
          visited[nr * C + nc] = true;
        }
      }
    }
    steps += 1;
  }
  return -1;

  function findStart() {
    for (let r = 0; r < R; r += 1) {
      for (let c = 0; c < C; c += 1) {
        if (grid[r][c] == "*") return [r, c];
      }
    }
  }
};
```
