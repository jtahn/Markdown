```python
class Solution:
    def walls_and_gates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:

```

# Description

You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

- `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
- `0` A gate.
- `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417144419.png)  
**Input:** `rooms = [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]`  
**Output:** `[[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]`


**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `rooms = [[-1]]`  
**Output:** `[[-1]]`

**Constraints:**
- `m == rooms.length`
- `n == rooms[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 250`
- `rooms[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `2^31 - 1`.

# References

## bfs on leaves
- compare with [542. 01 Matrix](542.%2001%20Matrix.md)
- this problem is slightly more complicated, bc you wont reach disconnected nodes
	- so strategy diff: after the bfs completes, you need to also mark all still unvisited nodes as unreachable
	- but ultimately there's no big implementation diff...bc by default, rooms have the unreachable value
	- (but point is: I think it's important to realize why this problem is different...and if this problem had initialized rooms with a diff value, then you would have to implement this step)
