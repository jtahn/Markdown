[226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
```

# Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return _its root_.

**Example 1:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220340.png)  
**Input:** `root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]`  
**Output:** `[4,7,2,9,6,3,1]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220351.png)  
**Input:** `root = [2,1,3]`  
**Output:** `[2,3,1]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `root = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

# Results 
- this problem is so trivial; maybe it should be fundamental problem for a bunch of related stuff
	- queues (CLRS)
	- queues (python implementation)
	- DFS, BFS
		- types/order of traversals



# Implementations

## Traverse
```
""" ITERATIVE """
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    stack = [root]              			# queue = collections.deque([(root)])
    while stack:                			# queue
        node = stack.pop()      			# queue.popleft()
        if node:
            node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left
            stack.extend([node.left, node.right])     # queue.extend
	return root


""" RECURSIVE """
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    if root:
        root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right),
							        self.invertTree(root.left)
    return root
```
- strategy
	- any traversal works
		- iterative DFS/BFS
		- recursive (inherently DFS)
	- (DFS/BFS both work)
	- for each node, switch children
- implementation
	- iterative
		- pop node in stack/queue
		- invert the children
		- add children to the stack/queue
	- recursive
		- this function takes the root as input, and needs to return the root as output as well.
			- so then the body of the function should just invert the children, and also call itself on the children as well
			- can save lines by realizing that the call on children also returns the children
- common errors
	- forgetting `if node` / `if root`
	- (probly an error; check it) trying to make code more 'readable' by splitting up the oneliner
		- ie if you split it up: it becomes a 3-4 liner, not a 2 liner
		- like if you split up the left/right assignments into 2 lines, then you need to also have temp vars that store the og left and right nodes
		- (the reason oneliner works, is like: RHS of assignment statements gets entirely evaluated first, before you perform the assignment...todo: go find an article on this an put into anki zotero)
