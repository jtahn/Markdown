[155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:
- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

```
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        

    def pop(self) -> None:
        

    def top(self) -> int:
        

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```


**Example 1:**  
**Input**  
```
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
```
**Output**  
```
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]
```
**Explanation**  
```
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```

**Constraints:**
- `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`
- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
- At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

# todo
- change the heading titles
	- double/pair stack THE current min
	- double/pair stack IF current min
	- special stack if current min
- for 'double stack IF current min'
	- explain: how do you know when to push/pop the 'extra min'?
		- the condition has to be: you pop if the thing you're pulling out is equal to what you're being telling is the equal to the min
		- this basically forces you to also in turn say that if you add an element that's equal to the min you also have to stack them in again
		- so like there there aren't two options here there aren't two ways to do it or like oh if you're adding element that's equal to the min you don't have to add you don't have to stack them in as wel
			- no you have to because when you pop it if you're popping something that's equal to the min then you might be changing the min
			- so this has to be updated
			- so you have to have  a condition that you you do something special if you're popping something equal to the min
				- which means you have to do something special when you push something equal to the min
- for special stack:
	- again, confirm that: do something special if current min; not strictly new min
		- again, bc: when you pop, something's equal to the min
			- it means that when you pop this, the min might change
			- so that's why you have to pop if it's equal to the current min
			- and so that forces: when you push, you do something special when it's equal to the current min

# observation
- `getMin()` does not pop the min; it just retrieves/peeks it

# Always stack the current min
```
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        val = min(val, self.minStack[-1] if self.minStack else val)
        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]
```

- strategy
	- always store the corresponding min of a value
	- maintain a stack and a "min stack"
		- `minstack[i-1] = min(stack[:i])`
		- ie top of minstack is always the min of stack
- complexity
	- doubles the space complexity over a normal stack
- alternative
	- use 1 stack of tuples



# Only stack new mins
- idea
	- only store the corresponding min, if it's a new min

### 2 stacks

### 1 stack

```
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min = -math.inf

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        if val <= self.min:
	        self.stack.append(self.min)
	        self.min = val    
		self.stack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
	    val = self.stack.pop()
        if val == self.min:
	        self.min = self.stack.pop()
		return val

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.min
```
- strategy
	- keep track of `currMin` of "stack"
	- before you push `newVal`
		- push `currMin`, if `newVal <= currMin`
	- when you pop `top`:
		- if `top == currMin`, then replace `currMin` with the next pop
			- ie, replace with the item right under it
- complexity
	- space
		- won't improve asymptotic space complexity
		- but in practice, should be more efficient
		- worst case, uses same amt as 2 stacks
			- ie: monotone decreasing sequence



# Don't exclusively stack elements (best)

- idea
	- suppose you know the current min, and you receive an element that will be a new min
	- we can insert a number in the stack, such that when we pop off this number in the future, we will be able to do all of:
		- know there will be a new min
		- what that new min should be
			- aka obtain the previous min, before this element was added to the 'stack'
		- what the element we just popped should be
	- ie currMin + s.top() will let you compute all those 3 things
- complexity
	- time O(n)
	- space O(1)
- apparent cons
	- integer overflow
- strategy
	- stack will not necessarily hold the actual values of the elements
	- instead of stacking elements, we stack a formula in terms of the elements
		- tho this can end up just being the element itself
	- note:
		- push/pop items to stack, will corresp to push/pop the elements
	- mn will always hold the min value of the elements
		- if mn is greater than s.top()
			- then s.top() lets us figure out all of the stuff listed in "idea"
		- note: mn is NOT the min value of the stack; bc the stack is not of the elements; it is a stack of values that corresp to the elements
