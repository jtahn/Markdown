[684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        
```

# Description

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the graph.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417153912.png)  
**Input:** `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`  
**Output:** `[2,3]`

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417153924.png)  
**Input:** `edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]`  
**Output:** `[1,4]`

**Constraints:**
- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= a_i < b_i <= edges.length`
- `a_i != b_i`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

# Results

## #trees/def
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Definitions
	- G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G
		- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1569073/how-can-i-prove-that-by-adding-one-edge-to-g-you-create-a-cycle-in-g
		- https://www.matthewkahle.org/download/file/fid/570
			- Chapter 11: #53:
				- Prove that a graph is a tree if and only if it does not contain any cycles, but the insertion of any new edge always creates exactly one cycle.
		- https://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/mugal4/efficiently_detecting_cycles_in_a_tree_graph_when/gv62sgi/


- problem statement says we started with a tree that has an edge added
- by above def, we know: this mean it created a cycle
- then this problem boils down to:
	- detecting the cycle, and removing an edge from this cycle
		- specifically, edge that was last in input
	- #/cleanup (even tho this 'last' edge isn't necessarily the 'added' edge...why is it also redundant?
		- (this is 'obvious', but atm seems annoying to explain)


## #trees/union_find
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure#Applications
- based on above 'cycle' strat: union-find works perfectly here:
	- iterate over edges to update connected components
	- if an edge is inserted into an already connected component:
		- we know this creates a cycle
		- return this redundant edge

- #/cleanup why will this 'cycle creation' only happen once?
	- the subtle/difficult thing to explain here, is why we know we are returning the redundant edge that occurs last in input



# Approaches




```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        par = [i for i in range(len(edges) + 1)]
        rank = [1] * (len(edges) + 1)

        def find(n):
            p = par[n]
            while p != par[p]:
                par[p] = par[par[p]]
                p = par[p]
            return p

        # return False if already unioned
        def union(n1, n2):
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)

            if p1 == p2:
                return False
            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:
                par[p2] = p1
                rank[p1] += rank[p2]
            else:
                par[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]
            return True

        for n1, n2 in edges:
            if not union(n1, n2):
                return [n1, n2]
