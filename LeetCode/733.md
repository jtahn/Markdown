https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/

An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a **flood fill** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected **4-directionally** to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `color`.

Return _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.

**Example 1:**
![](../../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224222750.png)
**Input:** `image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2`
**Output:** `[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]`
**Explanation:** From the center of the image with position `(sr, sc) = (1, 1)` (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.

**Example 2:**
**Input:**` image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0`
**Output:** `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`
**Explanation:** The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.

**Constraints:**
- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], color < 2^16`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

# DFS/BFS
```
def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if image[sr][sc] == color:          # avoid infinite loop, if startCoord is already newColor
        return image
    
    x, y = len(image), len(image[0])    # need later: to check whether coord is in bounds
    oldColor = image[sr][sc]            # need later: to check whether coord is oldColor

    # only push oldColor, so no need to track visited aka newColor
    stack = [(sr,sc)]   # queue = collections.deque([(sr,sc)])
    while stack:        # while queue:
        r,c = stack.pop()   # queue.popleft()
        image[r][c] = color     
        for coord in [(r-1,c), (r+1,c), (r,c-1), (r,c+1)]:
            i,j=coord
            if 0<=i<x and 0<=j<y and image[i][j]==oldColor:
                stack.append(coord)
    return image
```

can use a stack/queue to:
initial: starting node
process: fill with new color
valid: in bounds and is old color

or similarly: can do it recursively by creating an aux function that, given a node:
- changes its color if valid
- recursively applies itself to all neighbors

or similarly:
- changes its color
- recursively applies itself to valid neighbors

- edge cases
	- new color is the same as starting pixel color
- complexity
	- O(nm) time and space for n rows, m columns
