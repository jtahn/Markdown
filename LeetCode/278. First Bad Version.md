[278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

```
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        
```

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `n = 5, bad = 4`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:**  
```
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `n = 1, bad = 1`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

# todo

- there is a 3 case variant
	- (so add the code)
	- mid is solution if:
		- mid=bad, mid-1=good

- binary search:
	- imo the ‘binary search’ problem (iirc num 704):
	- should NOT be where i include all discussions of stuff
		- bc point is, very difficult to understand why these matter, unless looking at examples
	- do include code for all variants, bc its simple. but point is, for discussions: just cite other stuff
	- meta: it might seem weird to do it like this, but it actually makes sense; bc point is, bc 704 has so many possible solutions, then it shouldnt be the fp for all these discussions
		- to blurb/meta: aka discussion should only happen if that problem is a very good example for that discussion
		- binary search discussion should only be able: ‘general idea behind technique is to halve the search space’
	- instead, use it as a TOC for possible places where the variants come up
		- so i’d put listings for 278 (valid vs earliest valid)
		- and koko (2 vs 3 case)


- fundy for ‘binary search when you want to find ‘earliest valid’
	- point is that you need to be careful that you are finding the earliest valid; not just ‘valid’
	- koko eating bananas should cite this
		- difference for koko: shouldnt use 3 case, bc relatively inefficient
		- koko maybe should fp for: ‘when to not use 3 case’
		- ie: 3 cases is possible, but inappropriate:
			- but you essentially just repeat same computation for both mid and mid-1
			- so: in general, ‘better constant’/’cleaner code’ if you do 2 case
	- basically: this problem and koko: elements are invalid or valid
		- invalid = good; valid = bad
		- invalid = didnt finish bananas; valid = finished bananas
		- but both problems: it’s not enough to be valid: we are looking for ‘best’ valid
			- aka EARLIEST valid
	- iirc wikipedia article for binary search mentions this...the general code template is like ‘earliest occurrence’ or something like that
		- (aka use their jargon)

- strategy
	- modified binary search
		- ensure bad version is always within inclusive range `[left,right]`
		- we adjust `left` or `right` based on the property: "all the versions after a bad version are also bad":
			- if `mid` is bad
				- then first bad is either `mid` or earlier
				- so we now know bad is in `[left,mid]`
			- if `mid` is good
				- then first bad is strictly after `mid`
				- so bad must be in `[mid+1,right]`
		- once `left==right`, return either
- common errors
	- note `left = 1` bc versions start at 1, not 0
- note
	- this isn't identical to binary search because:
		- we know the key exists; ie search won't fail
		- we're not searching for a key; what we're really searching for is the index where
			- `isBadVersion(i) == true`
			- if version `i-1` exists, then `isBadVersion(i-1) == false`
		- (so you can't modify code so that it's "3 cases" like binary search...bc that's not how the cases in this problem work)
