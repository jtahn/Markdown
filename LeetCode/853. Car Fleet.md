[853. Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description
There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return _the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:**  
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.  
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.  
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.  
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:**  
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.  
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.  

**Constraints:**
- `n == position.length == speed.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 < target <= 10^6`
- `0 <= position[i] < target`
- All the values of `position` are **unique**.
- `0 < speed[i] <= 10^6`

## #simulation 
- aka find a structure that looks like the problem
- can you think of data structures that “visually’ model/look like what you’re trying to model/solve
- the stack is like ‘directly modeling how things happen irl’
	- like the way cars “bunch up”, is like what happens in a stack


## am i actually utilizing the structure
- definition of utilize:
	- 'using something FULLY'
- when you use a data structure to model a problem: are you actually using all the ‘defining/fundamental properties’ of the structure?
	- if not: can you use a simpler (or no) structure?
	- bc: possibly better space complexity
- ie here:
	- since we never pop from the stack..maybe this should imply you don't actually need a stack



# Abstract
- strict priority, and want to know how many 'groups'



# Approaches

## (global observations)
- ETA = time it takes to reach destination
- if car is alone, then ETA is:
	- `t = (target - position[i]) / speed[i]`



## model the problem via structure
```
"""stack (only add if fleet leader)"""
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for pos, vel in sorted(zip(position, speed))[::-1]:
            dist = target - pos
            if not stack:
                stack.append(dist / vel)
            elif dist / vel > stack[-1]:
                stack.append(dist / vel)
        return len(stack)


"""stack"""
"""seems slightly inefficient (doesnt matter asymptotically) bc you always append, and pop if its not a fleet leader"""
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        pair = [(p, s) for p, s in zip(position, speed)]
        pair.sort(reverse=True)
        stack = []
        for p, s in pair:  # Reverse Sorted Order
            stack.append((target - p) / s)
            if len(stack) >= 2 and stack[-1] <= stack[-2]:
                stack.pop()
        return len(stack)
```

- complexity
	- O(n) space bc of stack


So while looping through a sorted list of cars based on position, we can solve for each car's time to finish and check to see if the car's time of the car we want to add onto our stack is >= to the car's time on top of the stack. While that is true, we can pop the cars from the stack, as we have a new fleet leader, and eventually add the car to the stack when our condition is met.

When we finish, our stack will be filled with the lead car of all the fleets, finishing time. So we can return the length of our stack to answer our question.



## no data structure
```
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        prev_t = None
        n = 0
        for pos, vel in sorted(zip(position, speed))[::-1]:
            dist = target - pos
            t = dist / vel
            if not prev_t or t > prev_t:
                prev_t = t
                n += 1
        return n

```



- fix a car:
	- if all cars ahead of it have same or shorter ETA:
		- then this car starts a new fleet
	- else
		- ie if exists one car ahead of it with a longer ETA
		- then at some point, the current car joins a fleet



sorting the cars based on their starting positions, we can iterate from the one closest to the destination to the one furthest from it

If t is greater than the pre (the previous fleet's time), this means that the current car will not catch up to the fleet(s) ahead before reaching the destination, and thus we increment our fleet count ans. The current car's time then becomes the new pre.



- note:
	- many ppl seem to solve this with stacks
		- bc its a simple way to keep track of the 'fleet leader'
		- and you need to feed in by position
		- but this is kind of unecessary...bc all we really need to know is "current fleet leader speed" and "num felets so far"; ie stack is more than we need for this
- complexity
	- depends on the sorting algo
