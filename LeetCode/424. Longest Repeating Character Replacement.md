[424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

```
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        
```

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "ABAB", k = 2`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "AABABBA", k = 1`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".  
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.  
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`

# todo

- attempt to figure out the key idea:
	- idea: ‘transformed search space’
		- point is that: key step is: for each substring, we immediately associate ‘best solution generated from that substring’
			- which is just, pick a char that achieves highest freq
	- actually better way: an approach to finding ‘best’:
		- for each candidate: what is the ‘best’?
		- then: is the ‘max’ over all these ‘bests’ might be the solution?


- revise
	- instead of “alternative name descriptions”:
	- point is: key observation:
		- we only care about count of most frequent char
		

- the ‘final key idea’ is too complicated; i need to build up to it:
	- an equivalent version of the ‘final key idea’ is:
		- ‘problem is equivalent to finding the longest substring where the most frequent letter occurs at least m-k times’
			- ‘all letters except at most k, are the same’
		- (yea i don’t like this....the jump here is waaay too big)
		- i think my other idea where like: ‘think of max of maxes’ is much better...
	

- first key idea
	- phrase the problem/solution as an ‘extreme value’ problem; ie finding a max or min
	- steps
		- identify search space (ie all substrings)
		- think about what key/score/value to assign to each element of space
			- ie here: length of the substring, if valid
				- aka assign 0 if invalid
					- aka the freq of a most freq elt doesnt meet m-k threshold
					- ie other chars occur at most k times
			- importantly: in such a way, that an extreme value (here: max) is a solution
				- if you want the solution to be ‘min’; then you’d assign infinity to invalid stuff
		- return solution, aka (an elt that achieves) the extreme score


- slight variant (but still essentially equivalent; it’s not a ‘different approach’)
	- (actually imo this is the better version; bc then dont have to ‘worry’ about assigning 0 or infinity to invalid stuff)
		- yea this is the better version: bc it makes very clear what the diff btwn brute force and 2pointer
	- could interpret: restrict ‘search space’ to only valid stuff
		- ie for all things in ‘search space’:
		- first decide if it belongs in ‘valid search space
			- ie all substrings where ‘chars except for most freq’ occur at most k times
		- if so: compute its key
		- then return extreme from valid search space
	- so steps:
		- for elt in search space:
			- decide if valid
			- if valid, compute score
			- if new extreme, store elt/score as current solution
		- (actually now i write it like this..yea this is def ‘better’ than the previous variant..cuz why would you store scores of everything if you already know u only care about the extreme; aka no need to invalids, aka no need to think about ‘setting stuff to 0 or infinity’)
	- and point is: diff between brute and 2p, is how the iterate ‘for elt in search space’:



- then the second key idea:
	- is there a way to iterate, so that ‘computing the key/score/value’ is far more efficient?


- 2p realizes:
	- step 1: think of other ways to iterate
	- step 2: can we skip iterations
	- iterate over: start and length of substrings
		- left corresp to start
		- right incorporates start and length
		- (maybe rewrite code so that it uses vars start and length? instead of left and right?)
	- i dont think you can write the ‘global iteration’ as 2 nested loops
		- ie ‘for all starts’ and ‘for all lengths’..not really a way to nest it?
		- (so maybe this is a general observation about 2 pointer; maybe, can’t always go directly from ‘brute force loop implementation’ to ‘2p implementation’...instead, take a step back and think about what quantities you are iterating over)
	- but point is, global iteration is iterating over all possible combos of these two quantities, which clearly covers whole subspace
		- aka this is the brute force iteration underlying 2p



- meta/future/blurb:
	- this problem should be ‘2 pointer’, not ‘sliding window’ 
		- cuz its ‘eliminating iterations’, which is core idea behind 2p
		- and the ‘window’ isnt just ‘sliding’..its ‘expanding’ too
		- if you allowed ‘expanding’, then why cant you allow ‘shrinking’..which would then mean a bunch of other 2p methods could now be considered ‘sliding window’, which imo is nonsense





# Equivalent definition of solution
- we define: a substring is 'valid' if:
	- we can replace up to k characters, so that the substring is then purely a repeated character
		- ie will have only 1 unique character
- so the problem is asking us: find the length of the longest valid substring
	- note: there could be multiple
- observe
	- fix an instance of this problem
	- let `m` be the length of a solution to this instance
		- (meta/todo: fixing a length is key to understanding what solutions look like)
			- wait maybe not? equivalent formulation of problem:
				- find longest substring where:
					- `length - "count of most frequent character" <= k`
		- note solutions are not necessarily unique
		- however, we do know they all have the same length
	- then a solution is any substring `t` of length `m` such that:
		- there exists a letter with (exactly) `m-k` occurrences in `t`
			- can't be higher, else we could just add increase substring on either side, do replacements, and have a substring with `m+1` repeats
			- can't be lower else this wouldn't have been a solution; bc no way to get to m repeats
			- it's fine if there's multiple letters satisfy this; regardless of which letter you keep, then you get a string with m repeats
		- (because then, we can change the other $k$ letters to match that letter)
- summary
	- the above discussion tells us that:
		- a valid substring satisfies `length - maxCount <= k`
		- in terms of what these cases actually mean (ie not just valid or invalid):
			- if `length - maxCount == 0`, then replacements can be done so that we have purely a repeated character
			- if `length - maxCount > 0`, then there is still more than 1 unique char in the substring after any k replacements
			- if `length - maxCount < 0`, then substring can be purely a repeated char
				- but we can also add more chars to substring, and still be valid, bc we still have replacements that we are allowed to do
	- alternative names/descriptions for this observation:
		- equivalent definition of solution
		- to determine a solution: we only care about the count of the most frequent character


# Brute force
- this is 'brute force' informed by the equivalent definition above
	- you can come up with far more brutal 'brute forces' if you don't use the above property
- strategy
	- iterate over all substrings
		- let m be length of current substring
		- using property above, it is sufficient to check if there is a character present at least m-k times
	- return highest m where the check succeeded
- why i mention this brute force:
	- the property above already leads to an algo that is pretty simple to understand
	- the diff btwn this algo and sliding window:
		- sliding window essentially figures out how we can iterate over substrings (absurdly) efficiently

# Sliding window (or two pointer?)
```
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
	    
        l = 0			# left pointer
        maxf = 0		# frequency of the most common char in the window
        
        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
            maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])	

            if (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1

        return (r - l + 1)
```

- observation: the 'simple routine' inside brute force is good, but we can drastically improve how we iterate
	- ie we can ignore a lot of substring/states
- proof: why we can ignore states
	- summary
		- right pointer
			- we dont care about substrings with length below currMaxLength
		- left pointer
			- we dont care about substrings starting here, bc we know there are no solutions with length above currMaxlength
			- (note: when left pointer is moved, we move auto move right pointer as well without even needing to check the state before we move it..bc we alrdy know we can throw it away, bc substring isnt long enouhg to care)
			- aka:
				- this happens when we're alrdy at the max cap of 'replaced' letters
				- we know that substring of length m starting at this left pointer is not a solution
					- this implies: cannot be a solution of any length higher than m as well
					- any length lower than m we dont care about, bc we've alrdy found a solution
				- thus, no need to check substrings starting at this pointer anymore
- more implementation details
	- length of the current window/substring is `end - start + 1` aka `r - l + 1`
	- let `maxf` be the frequency/count of the most frequent char
	- satisfying the condition in the 'observation' above is equivalent to:
		- `length - maxf <= k`
			- `length - maxf` is num chars that are NOT the "fixed" char
				- "fixed" char = a chosen character that occurs most
				- there could be multiple, so we choose one
		- aka `r-l+1 - maxf <= k`
	- at the end of the loop, `l` and `r` are endpoints of a solution
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space
