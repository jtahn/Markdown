[383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        
```

# Description
Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` _if_ `ransomNote` _can be constructed by using the letters from_ `magazine` _and_ `false` _otherwise_.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"`  
**Output:** `false`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"`  
**Output:** `true`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 10^5`
- `ransomNote` and `magazine` consist of lowercase English letters.

## python dictionary basics
- comparing dictionaries
	- (and thus, Counters)
- Counter is a sub class/type of dict class/type?
- defaultdict



- 'fill structure with counts’
	- to fill dict, should be iterating through note
		- not iterate through set(randomnote), ‘abc...’ or ‘string ascii lowercase’
			- iterating through these means you’d have to make 26 passes through the note
- when filling structure:
	- obviously just iterate through the element
	- do NOT: 'for every alphabet letter, compute count in word'
	- the latter is what you might use for COMPARING counts; not for CONSTRUCTING counts



- comparing counts: iterating options:	
	- `set(ransomNote)`
	- `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`
		- in general, faster than above two
	- `string.ascii_lowercase`
		- apparently more reliable/safer than the above?

	- python: use ‘string ascii lowercase’ instead of manually writing ‘abcdef...’
	- small optimization: iterating through set(iterable) instead of iterable
		- candidate: ‘equality of 2 dictionaries’..ie ‘valid anagram’



- Counter
	- variety of builtins that let you compare counts
		- `return Counter(note) <= Counter(magazine)`
		- `return not Counter(note) - Counter(magazine)`
		- `return note & magazine == note`
	- (can dict use the same comparisons?)





# Results



## use equality to solve inequality
- recall [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md)
- we can think of this problem as a more complicated variant
	- bc we also allow 'containment'
- can consider the techniques below, as adaptations of the techniques from the 'equality' case




## flipping iterator and pointer
- used in the 'sort' solution



- 2 implementation variants:
	- whether the outer loop is over the magazine/big or note/small
	- if outer = big:
		- (seems slightly simpler)
		- inner routine: (IF): move small iterator if there’s a match
		- return: success if small iterator fully traversed small
	- if outer = small:
		- inner routine: (WHILE): keep moving big iterator until we find a match
		- return fail if big iterator fully traversed before outer loop ended
		- (imo this is the more ‘natural’ way to think about it..this is like ‘check if small inside big’)
			- the other version is like, ‘check if big is outside small’
			- (but other version is very slightly simpler to code)
			- (but this might be a blurb: there’s surely future problems, where much bigger difference in difficulty of coding, based on how you interpret these problems...aka equivalent vs best/simplest)


- is there jargon here for ‘main/primary/outer loop/iterator’ and ‘secondary/inner’?
	- actually there’s only 1 loop tbh; so this is the iterator
	- the ‘inner’ loop: it’s not really an iterator..a more correct word seems like ‘pointer’
	- ie you have an iterator and a pointer; and you decide which to assign these to big/small





# Implementations

## Sort and compare
- implementations
	- loop over big, point to small
	- loop over small, point to big

```
# loop over big
def canConstruct(self, ransomNote, magazine):
	s = sorted(ransomNote)
	i = 0

	for c in sorted(magazine):
		i += i < len(s) and s[i] == c

	return i == len(s)




# loop over small


	for c in sorted(ransomNote):


```





- situation: containers have a ‘well-defined order’
	- aka here: it’s bc we sorted the strings
	- checking containment (ie whether small container is subset of big container)
- strategy: iterating through the containers
- (equality is much simpler, bc you just break the moment you have things that dont match)


- strategy
	- sort strings
	- check for "containment"
		- (probly no built-ins that do this, so do it manually via a "traversal")
		- iterate through the magazine
			- advance a pointer on the note if we have matching letters
- complexity (n is combined length of the strings)
	- time
		- depends on sorting algo
		- at least O(n log n)
	- O(1) space




# Compare counts
- implementations
	- construct two counts, then compare
	- increment count with one; then decrement with the other
```
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        r_counter = Counter(ransomNote)
        m_counter = Counter(magazine)
        
        # magazine contains (>=) ransomNote
        for c in ransomNote:
            if m_counter[c] < r_counter[c]:
                return False
        return True
```

- strategy
	- construct counts
	- compare counts
- complexity
	- O(n) time where n is the combined length of the strings
		- you have to iterate through them
	- O(1) space bc there's only 26 letters; so storing counts is at most size 52, if i store for both strings
