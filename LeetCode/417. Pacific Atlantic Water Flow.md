    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
```

# Description
There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return _a **2D list** of grid coordinates_ `result` _where_ `result[i] = [ri, ci]` _denotes that rain water can flow from cell_ `(ri, ci)` _to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417153142.png)  
**Input:** `heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]`  
**Output:** `[[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]`  
**Explanation:** 
```
The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `heights = [[1]]`  
**Output:** `[[0,0]]`  
**Explanation:** The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Constraints:**
- `m == heights.length`
- `n == heights[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10^5`

# References

## start traversal on leaves
- is there better jargon here? this isn't a "tree"..i feel like i should call it something other than 'leaves'


## hash collisions
- so we don't repeat traversals through nodes


# Results

## graph is the solution
- so really the solution is about defining what it means to be in the graph
	- ie what nodes are in the graph
	- and so then traversal follows very naturally


- equivalently: 'what we mean by neighbor of a node'
- imo the idea for this approach is that: any node in the traversal is a solution
	- so then a neighbor in the graph: valid node where water can flow
- ie it's true we're "reading" the entire matrix; but imo we don't actually "traverse" the entire matrix
	- like imo this is a better way to think of it, instead of:
		- "we're traversing the entire matrix to check what is a solution"

- (todo: write code to align with this approach)
	- actually in general, modify a lot of my 'graph solutions' with this approach
		- [542. 01 Matrix](542.%2001%20Matrix.md)
		- [733. Flood Fill](733.%20Flood%20Fill.md)
	- ie a lot of sample code: in the aux function, you'll see ppl have like a 'base case' where they take care of stuff like boundaries; and then an empty return statement
	- im saying, instead move this stuff later in the function: ie dont actually make a recursive call, unless we satisfy this boundary stuff
		- bc point is: we only make recursive calls on nodes in the graph
		- (and do this because: this is skiena's template, and there's probly a very good reason he wrote the template like this..i'll find out in the future as i do more problems)

	- one definite benefit: less stuff in the call stack


- also this approach:
	- another key is that: in order to traverse the graph: you need to figure out where to start the traversals. aka:
		- what nodes do you already know in the graph
		- what nodes do you have conditions that let you know, where to move in the graph





---



- here: so we don't repeat traversals through nodes that have already been visited
	- also doubles as the solution
	- ie when we discover a node: we process it so that it's never processed again
		- if solution: it's now in the collision set, aka solution
		- if not solution: then it's invalid....so traversals never continue here...
- todo: jargon: i think we never really 'traverse' through invalid nodes
	- so these are never actually 'nodes'...so they're not discovered/undiscovered/etc
	- well actually: i think the typical way to write the code:
		- you put the 'invalid path' as part of the 'vertex early' check
		- just bc it makes it simpler to write code this way?
	- actually no, imo: do

```
for each of the 4 positions:
	if in bounds and not in hash/solution/visited set:
		run dfs
```

so the above: the first 2 lines are your 'for each neighbor' check


and btw your process-vertex-early will just be

```
add node to hash/solution/visited set
```

you want to do this asap so that future dfs traversals wont attempt this node again;
ie you dont put in vertex-late, else you'll just get an infinite loop











# Approaches

- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/417
- https://leetcode.ca/2017-01-20-417-Pacific-Atlantic-Water-Flow/
- two traversals: one for atlantic, one for pacific
	- start them at the border cells (ie we already know they can reach the designated ocean) 
	- doesn't matter which traversal
	- we extend traversal through nodes with valid water flow
	- for dfs: the nature of it means you can equivalently just start a dfs traversal at each border cell
		- (bc this is essentially what would've happened anyways, you had initialized the stack with all the border cells)
		- see approach 1
			- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0400-0499/pacific-atlantic-water-flow-medium
			- also neetcode
- set to track collisions
	- aka don't need to traverse through a node, bc already done it
