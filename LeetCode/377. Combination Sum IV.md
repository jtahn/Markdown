[377. Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return _the number of possible combinations that add up to_ `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3], target = 4`  
**Output:** `7`  
**Explanation:**  
```
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [9], target = 3`  
**Output:** `0`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.
- `1 <= target <= 1000`

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

## Errata
- from Example 1, it's not actually combinations; it's permutations with replacement

- think about the follow-up question
- and see if there is a problem for it

- standard approach:
	- dp on target
- this seems incredibly similar to another basic dp problem i did int he past..if not identical...coin change?
