[70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.  
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.  
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`

- it seems recursion typically needs an aux function, so maybe mention this is okay
	- and that in python, it apparently seems standard to have aux functions defined within functions
- have a discussion about why we can define functions inside functions in python
	- and maybe also, whether it's better to define aux function as a class method instead, ie outside the 'main' function




## tbd
- if the solution is a count over elements; then figure out a method that doesn't require actually creating the elements
	- aka far better space efficiency

	- it seems: both top-down and bottom-up are considered dp
		- both only solve a subproblem once
		- top-down uses memoization
		- bottom-up uses 'tabulation'
			- and is typically better space efficiency?
	- ehh go check skiena..iirc skiena doesnt consider top-down to be dynamic programming
	- also confirm the jargon here:
		- seems memoization and tabulation are 'implementation techniques'
		- top-down and bottom-up are 'strategies' of the order in which you 'directly' decide to call functions to solve (sub)problems
- the explanation i give here (wrt memoization/top-down vs dp/bottom-up) should align with fibonacci
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Fibonacci_sequence
- i highly suspect there's a direct connect of bottom-up with recurrence relations
	- and this interpretation will likely seem far more natural to me bc of my math background

		- he is interpreting the bottom-up strategy incorrectly
		- it's not "start at steps 4 and 5, and see how we can get to step 5; then compute from step 3; then step 2; etc"
			- doesn't even make sense to start at step 5, bc can't take 0 steps
		- see fibonacci above: it should be: first compute solution to problem for base cases, ie when staircase is size 1 and 2
			- then compute 3 using previous; then 4; etc
	- (worrying bc this is such a simple problem)
	- however: he consistently does provide the optimal solution and all the correct/necessary jargon
		- so he's still a decent source to use
	- the point is, i need to go back to the more reputable resources (ie even wikipedia) and confirm the explanation

# Approaches


## dynamic programming

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n
        n1, n2 = 2, 3

        for i in range(4, n + 1):
            temp = n1 + n2
            n1 = n2
            n2 = temp
        return n2

```
