https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.


**Example 1:**
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`
**Output:** `4`
**Explanation:** 9 exists in `nums` and its index is 4

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2`
**Output:** `-1`
**Explanation:** 2 does not exist in `nums` so return -1


**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

# binary search
```
def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    i = 0
    j = len(nums)-1
    while i<=j:
        m = (i+j)//2
        if target == nums[m]:
            return m
        elif target < nums[m]:
            j = m-1
        else:
            i = m+1
    return -1
```

- compare an element in the middle of the array with the target value  
- If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned  
- If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array  
- If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.  
  
diagram: ``[i .... m-1] [m] [m+1 ...... j] `
so either return m or adjust i or j


## optimizations
- leave out the middle comparison: results in a faster comparison loop.

# errors
- avoiding overflow errors: instead of (i+j)//2, do i + (j-i)//2
	- though this likely is now computing ceiling of (i+j)/2
- watch out! which direction you're rounding in your integer division:

if this operator rounds down,
then the comparison inside MUST be val < target.
because look small case, adjacent indicies i and j.
so array we've narrowed down to, it looks like
`[i j]`
then computing m, this is equivalent to `[m   m+1]`
thus the comparison needs to result in either:
i = m+1
or j = m
which means comparison needs to be val < target
NOT val <= target
the latter requires i = m or j = m-1
else the while loop doesn't terminate, bc you are permanently stuck on the array 
`[i j] = [i   i+1] = [m   m+1]`
