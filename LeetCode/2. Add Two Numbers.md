# Definition for singly-linked list.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:

```

# Description
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110749.png)  
**Input:** `l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]`  
**Output:** `[7,0,8]`  
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `l1 = [0], l2 = [0]`  
**Output:** `[0]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]`  
**Output:** `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## recursion patterns
- future: is there 'jargon' for 'recursion' patterns?
	- for recursion...i think there's going to be a pattern here...of diff types of recursion? go look it up
		- like this problem is an example of:
			- recursive calls are made before the return
		- versus other types of recursion: the return contains the recursive call
	- also note here: i think you can compute digit after the recursive call
	- aka the only thing where the 'order matters', is that recursive call is explicitly happening before the return?
	- (go look up recursion general patterns)
	- imo if there is jargon i can use here: this might be a very quick way for immediately understand, how to write a recursion algo
		- versus: reading through the code, then confirming it makes sense
	- ie im looking for a 'key idea'...aka something is broader than 'just read the code'
	- basically meta: i dont think 'recursion' is specific enough to immediately tell me, what the code should generally look like
		- so i think key idea is needed to make it more specific..like thats the point of key ideas..to essentially help me immediately realize what the structure of the algo will be like

# Results
## python integer overflow
- (this seems like the fundy for this)
	- like literally the reason why you would add as linkedlist, is bc you cant cast to int bc overflow
- namely: python doesn't worry about overflow
- this is why we can do that 'list-to-int' trick
	- and why: this trick likely does not translate to many other languages
- btw, the 'string to int to list' is basically the same idea

- i feel like other languages this might not work, bc max size on int
	- if so, i should note/explain: python doesnt have this issue
	- maybe this problem is fp for this?
		- that way binary search doesnt also have this discussion (binary search alrdy has so much stuff happening)
		- actually this might be better anyways: bc its more general
			- this problem is purely about max size of int
			- versus binary search: its a summation that leads to max size, which then is overflow


# Todo

## to blurb
- some things are way too 'python'/'language' specific
	- examples:
		- chain assignment
	- they should instead be a pure anki card
		- ie 'debug this code'
		- or 'understand this code'
			- used to help me understand other ppl's code, particularly ppl who enjoy one-liners
			- the intention is so that i'll be able to read code easier, when other ppl use these tricks
			- it is never for me to use these tricks in my own code; cuz imo, i dont think these tricks are helpful
				- they likely dont improve speed, and also make code less readable
				- also dont carry over to other languages, aka likely makes me more prone to bugs, bc i forget that diff languages cant do this


## to anki
- chain assignment
	- ie trick to combine lines of code

# Implementations




## cast to int
```
"""Recursive"""
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        def toint(node):
            return node.val + 10 * toint(node.next) if node else 0
        def tolist(n):
            node = ListNode(n % 10)

        while n > 9:

- interesting
	- depending on the language, this might be more time efficient than the above solutions
- Python supports arbitrarily large integers, so I can safely:
	- turn the two lists into ints, add them, and turn the sum into a list.
- possibly more efficient for some reason:
	- LinkedList to string to int to LinkedList



## kindergarten arithmetic

### 'Direct'
```
"""one node at a time"""
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
    dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
    carry = 0
    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        if l1:
            carry += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            carry += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        cur.next = ListNode(carry%10)
        cur = cur.next
        carry //= 10
    return dummy.next


"""one step at a time"""
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode()
        cur = dummy

        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # new digit
            val = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = val // 10
            val = val % 10
            cur.next = ListNode(val)

            # update ptrs
            cur = cur.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None


        return dummy.next



```



- explanation should be far more concise
- brief descriptions of variants (write as code comment):
	- “for each place, add digits if they exists”
	- “for each place, add everything; but if if it doesn’t exist, call it 0”


- ‘third technique’ is really just an ‘optimization’ variant for either of the two approaches above
	- mini optimization
	- can do in place by just replacing vals in one of the lists
	- the way you replace vals...use one of the two variants above
	- likely doesn’t need any explanation
		- probly enough to just: in code, maybe put a comment to make clear (if not obvious)
		- the line where you keep track if one of the lists is finished, and if so, do a routine to just break or append the rest of the unfinished list


- keep recursion code
	- preferably a comment; but explain how we plan to recurse
	- aux function:
		- compute digit
		- point to result of call on the next digit
		- return digit
	- (yea, i dont think i need to explain this: code seems simple enough)


---



- observation
	- see examples: lists are in reverse order, so just add like we were taught when we were little (ie add digits, then carry over) (aka column addition)
- strategy
	- keep track of carry over, for the next digit
	- dummy node, onto which we iteratively link our solution
		- so that at the end, we can just return `dummy.next`
	- for each digit:
		- sum values (if they exist)
		- update carry
		- link to dummy
		- update pointers
	- (todo: basically equivalent, but some ppl might prefer):
		- we only do stuff if node exists...and you can add + update nodes separately
- complexity
	- time  `O(max(m, n))`
		- where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`, respectively
	- `O(1)` space
		- if we don't include output




### (todo)
- one of the implementations is arguably 'better' bc it will generalize easier, ie:
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240312194400.png)






### 'Direct' in place
- strategy
	- similar to above, but just modify one of the lists directly
	- if one of the lists ends early, then make sure the currently modified list points to rest of the longer list (could be same list) (also might have to add one last carry...or keep adding a carry while it exists, ie if the longer lists is ending like 9999999 and you might keep carrying a 1...ie add a 'while carry' condition)


### Recursion
```
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        _ = l1.val + l2.val
        digit, tenth = _ % 10, _ // 10
        answer = ListNode(digit)
        if any((l1.next, l2.next, tenth)):
            l1 = l1.next if l1.next else ListNode(0)
            l2 = l2.next if l2.next else ListNode(0)
            l1.val += tenth
            answer.next = self.addTwoNumbers(l1, l2)    
        return answer
```

- might as well practice recursion
- same complexity
