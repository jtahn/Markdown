[45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:
- `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
- `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [2,3,0,1,4]`  
**Output:** `2`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

# todo

#/move 
- imo this is a bfs problem, NOT a greedy problem




# Strategies


## 'greedy'
- this one definitely feels like greedy
	- each 'step' is basically a range of indices
		- bounded by prev maxJump and current maxJump
- interesting thing about this problem is you never actually seem to pick a choice or 'solve a subproblem'
	- like this algo feels more like figuring out how many 'ranges' there are
	- ie how many 'subproblems' there are
	- so idk if this is even greedy either?
- i guess it's greedy in the sense that:
	- you pick the choice that gives you biggest maxJump, out of current range
- ohhh i think the thing here is:
	- subproblem is almost like a function of number of steps
	- NOT a function of the indices
	- f(n) = farthest point u can reach after n steps
		- and this can be solved by iterating over the range bounded by f(n-1)
			- the efficiency is to lower bound this range by f(n-2)
- algomonster is actually the same thing
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/45
		- bc `lastReach` is exactly he prev max jump
- ohhh neetcode makes the observation that i tihnk is correct:
	- this can be a BFS algorithm
	- yea make sense..bc 'min jumps' is like 'min distance'
	- yea hardway also calls it bfs

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        res = 0
        while r < (len(nums) - 1):
            maxJump = 0
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                maxJump = max(maxJump, i + nums[i])
            l = r + 1
            r = maxJump
            res += 1
        return res
