https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”



**Example 1:**
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224221249.png)
**Input:** `root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8`
**Output:** `6`
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**
![](../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224221302.png)
**Input:** `root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4`
**Output:** `2`
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1`
**Output:** `2`





**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

# 'traversal'
```
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
    if p.val > q.val:
        p,q = q,p
    while not p.val <= root.val <= q.val:
        if q.val < root.val:
            root = root.left
        else:
            root = root.right
    return root
```
- todo
	- idk what the official jargon/terminology is for this technique
		- there not actually be one: bc it seems the 'strategy' comes directly from knowing an equivalent characterization of the LCA condition (which is explained in the observations below)
		- once you know this property, then the 'algo' is just about traversing the tree based on this property
- notation
	- let x = LCA(p,q)
	- wlog p <= q
- observations (using the definition of BST and LCA)
	- x clearly exists
	- x is the unique ancestor that is either equal to one of p,q; or contains p,q on different subtrees
		- proof x contains on diff subtrees:
			- if x had p,q in the same subtree, then it wouldn't be the LCA; bc it's child would a lower node that is also an ancestor 
		- proof no other node contains on diff subtrees:
			- any parent of x has p,q in the same subtree
			- any child of x is a parent of at most one of p,q (otherwise, x wouldnt be the LCA)
	- 'diff subtrees' is equivalent to satisfying p <= x <= q
- strategy
	- find ancestor x satisfying p <= x <= q
	- iterative
		- starting at the root, descend until you find the x satisfying p <= x <= q
			- aka while not p <= x <= q
	- recursive
		- probly need an aux function?
		- checks if $p \leq x \leq q$
		- if not:
			- set x=x.child and repeat check
			- which child depends on if $x < p$  or $q < x$
