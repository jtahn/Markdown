[528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```

# Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the **weight** of the `i^th` index.

You need to implement the function `pickIndex()`, which **randomly** picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` (**inclusive**) and returns it. The **probability** of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

- For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e., `25%`), and the probability of picking index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e., `75%`).

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**  
```
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
```
**Output:** `[null,0]`  
**Explanation:**
```
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
```

**Example 2:**  
**Input:**
```
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
```
**Output:** `[null,1,1,1,1,0]`  
**Explanation:**
```
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
```


**Constraints:**
- `1 <= w.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
- `pickIndex` will be called at most `10^4` times.

# todo

- imo, adding reference subheadings is only necessary when the tag itself isn't sufficient enough 'explanation' of how the problem uses it
- ie if the strat uses a fundy in a very direct/obvious way, then imo just list the tag under the strat's heading
	- imo this is convenient for strats that use a bunch of fundeez at once, ESPECIALLY when they seem to be used in a very intertwined/depedent way on each other
		- ie it's not really like the application of 'fundeez' occur in a sequence
		- example: the 'inversion transform sampling' strat for [[528. Random Pick with Weight]]

	- In Statistics, if we nomalize (divided by `self.cdf[-1]`) the `self.cdf` into [0, 1], it's actually a discrete distribution `cdf` sequence. For cdf function, given `X` you can get the Cumulative Probability (aka percentile) of `X`, which is `Prob(x <= X)` .
	- The question is actually asking to generate random samples given by a specific statistical distribution. How?
	- Principle is easy, take uniform sample from the `cdf` squence ( which can be realized by `random` ), then use `inverse_cdf` function to find the variable `X`. The binary search here is actually `inverse_cdf` function, that returns the `X` given by a Cumulative Probability.
