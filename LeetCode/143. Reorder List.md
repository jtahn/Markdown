You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110311.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `[1,4,2,3]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110327.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,5,2,4,3]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

- use a data structure to make it very easy to determine how to link nodes
	- dynamic array
		- add all nodes to an dynamic array (ie can be resized; bc we dont know length of linked list), in order
		- then it's easy to just iterate indices on both ends, to link
			- example:
				- Once the array is filled, we initialize two variables `L` and `R` which denotes the current positions on the two ends from which we need to re-order the list in alternate fashion
				- In odd iteration, we assign the next node as `arr[L]` and move the `L` pointer ahead
				- In even iteration, we assign the next node as `arr[R]` and move the `R` pointer backward
				- This will re-order the list as alternating nodes from start and end as required.
	- stack
		- add all nodes to a stack
		- then between every two nodes, insert the one in the top of the stack
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space

- strategy
	- Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
		- be careful, it needs to work properly both for even and for odd number of nodes. For this we can either just count number of elements and then divide it by to, and do two traversals of list. Or we can use slow/fast iterators trick, where slow moves with speed 1 and fast moves with speed 2. Then when fast reches the end, slow will be in the middle, as we need.
	- Step 2: Reverse the last half of the linked list.
		- see [206. Reverse Linked List](206.%20Reverse%20Linked%20List.md)
		- The idea is to keep **three** pointers: `prev, curr, nextt` stand for previous, current and next and change connections in place. Do not forget to use `slow.next = None`, in opposite case you will have list with loop.
	- Step 3: Merge 2 list one by one.
		- see [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](21.%20Merge%20Two%20Sorted%20Lists.md)
		- Finally, we need to merge two lists, given its heads. These heads are denoted by `head`and `prev`, so for simplisity I created `head1` and `head2` variables. What we need to do now is to interchange nodes: we put `head2` as next element of `head1` and then say that `head1` is now `head2` and `head2` is previous `head1.next`. In this way we do one step for one of the lists and rename lists, so next time we will take element from `head2`, then rename again and so on.
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- do `O(n)` iterations to find middle, then we do `O(n)` iterations to reverse second half and finally we do `O(n)` iterations to merge lists.
	- O(1) space
- note
	- Can someone explain why `slow.next = None` is needed after reversing the second half of the linked list? I don't quite understand how removing it will result in a loop.
		- Without that line, `slow.next` will point to the last node in the _first half_ of the list. This will result in a cycle.
		- ie, the last node of first half list is still directed to the second list. In order to change that we have to set to None, else it will be a cycle.
		- For example, for list `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `slow.next = None` breaks it into `[1,2,3]` and `[6,5,4]`. Otherwise, we have `[1,2,3,4]` and `[6,5,4]`, which results in a cycle in step 3.


# 'Iterative but space efficient' (???)
- is this even possible
- strategy
	- 
- move a pointer all the way to last node
- then use 2 points at front and 2 pointers at back, to link things together
