# Description
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110311.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `[1,4,2,3]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227110327.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,5,2,4,3]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Reference


## linked list 'backwards' techniques

- standard approaches are
	- array
	- recursion, via aux function that:
		- returns node and distance
		- routines that execute based on certain distance
			- ie cases:
				- distance 0
				- distance n
				- everything else


# Approaches



## store nodes in memory
- implementations

```
- use a data structure to make it very easy to determine how to link nodes
	- dynamic array
		- add all nodes to an dynamic array (ie can be resized; bc we dont know length of linked list), in order
		- then it's easy to just iterate indices on both ends, to link
			- example:
				- Once the array is filled, we initialize two variables `L` and `R` which denotes the current positions on the two ends from which we need to re-order the list in alternate fashion
				- In odd iteration, we assign the next node as `arr[L]` and move the `L` pointer ahead
				- In even iteration, we assign the next node as `arr[R]` and move the `R` pointer backward
				- This will re-order the list as alternating nodes from start and end as required.
	- stack
		- add all nodes to a stack
		- then between every two nodes, insert the one in the top of the stack
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space




### recursion

```
def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:

	def rec(root: ListNode, cur: ListNode) -> ListNode:
		# base case
		if not cur:
			return root

		# recursive calls
		root = rec(root, cur.next)

		# skipped cases
		if not root:
			return None


		tmp = None

		# main case: case for last node of new list (ie mid)
		if root == cur or root.next == cur:
			cur.next = None

		# main case: for most other nodes
		else:
			tmp = root.next
			root.next = cur
			cur.next = tmp
		return tmp
		
	return rec(head, head.next)
```



#### recursion big idea
- todo
	- go to CLRS and figure out the correct jargon
	- Decide what should be the fundy for ‘recursion on linked lists’
		- this or [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](19.%20Remove%20Nth%20Node%20From%20End%20of%20List.md)
		- Whatever i choose: that prob should also cite ‘fundy for recursion’
			- Find some easy problem for this…
- So summary/order of routines
	- Base case
		- Comes before reclusive calls, bc base case shouldn’t do a recursive call
		- return value: to figure this out, probly happens simultaneously with thinking about what to do/return in the main routine, see below
	- Recursive calls
		- To reach/traverse to/‘start computations’ at end of list
		- bc ‘end of list’ is base case
		- This means that when the calls actually execute, it is wrt backwards iterations starting at the END of the list
	- main/important cases
		- this problem:
			- Do linking
		- other problem
			- Skip the nth node
		- determining return values: should also be informed by what the base case would be able to know
	- ’skipped’ cases
		- Determining return value: probly just figure out what to do, based on base and main cases
		- not all recursive algos need this
		- Used in this problem, and in ‘remove nth node from last node’
		- this problem:
			- Some recursive calls dont need to do any linking (aka recursive calls that execute in first half of list)
		- other problem:
			- Just keep the same liked node as before


- when recursion on linked list is appropriate:
	- When you need to perform operations that have an interpretation involving ‘iterating backwards from the end of the list’
	- even if they simultaneously involve beginning of the list: this is easy, bc you can pass head to the aux function/recursive calls

	
	
- because of structure of recursive calls
	- the value it returns, will be used by the node that made the call
		- ie next node at the 'back half'
		- bc 'returns' will traverse backwards
	- which means for Algo:
		- base case needs to be able to access the head
		- recursive routine needs to return the required node at the 'front end'

	- so when you think about main routines:
		- The nth node makes a call on the n+1node
		- The n+1 node will be returning info to the nth node
	- and base routines:
		- the first call that actually executes
		- It will know head



- to reach end of list, you need to make recursive calls
	- Means that the main routine, needs to be made wrt perspective of iterating from end of the list
	- Bc beginning of list cannot ‘operate on’ end of list

- knowing if you’re base case:
	- Seems 2 ways to implement: either
		- base case is None (aka last node points to this)
		- Base case is node point to none (aka last node)




#### understanding/edition current code

- clearly we want the 'main routine' to 'link stuff'
	- this means the routine needs to have:
		- front: curr node in the first half
		- back: curr node in the second half
	- we know recursive calls: executing for the back node
		- Which means return values need to take care of the front node



- root paramEter
	- it’s used so that the aux function has local access to the ‘head’ of the list
		- Specifically used in the base case
	- imo rename the parameter so that this is more obvious
		- ie that this parameter never actually changes, in recursive calls

- return variable
	- ie var set to the return value of a recursive call
	- Should DEFINITELY be renamed
		- Root is a TERRIBLE name for this
	- None is returned when the linking is completed
		- bc there are still recursive calls to unwrap


- complexity
	- time
	- space
		- probly O(n) bc call stack



## solve subproblem steps
- implementations
	- chain techniques
		- find middle of linked list
			- todo: maybe add the leetcode problem for this
		- [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](21.%20Merge%20Two%20Sorted%20Lists.md)
		- [206. Reverse Linked List](206.%20Reverse%20Linked%20List.md)

```
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp

        # merge two halfs
        first = head
        second = prev      # This is now the head of the reversed second half
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
```


- strategy
	- Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
		- be careful, it needs to work properly both for even and for odd number of nodes. 
		- For this we can either just count number of elements and then divide it by to, and do two traversals of list. 
		- Or we can use slow/fast iterators trick, where slow moves with speed 1 and fast moves with speed 2. Then when fast reches the end, slow will be in the middle, as we need.
			- We use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
			- The slow pointer advances one node at a time, while the fast pointer advances two nodes at a time. When the fast pointer either reaches the end of the list or the node before the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
			- a 2nd fast pointer that moves 2 nodes at a time, stopping only in the case when either our fast pointer reaches null, or fast's next pointer is null. By starting the slow pointer at the first node, and the fast pointer at the second node, we will always end off in the case of the slow node being left at the end of the first half, ready to move on to the second half. In the case of an odd number of nodes, the first half will be larger too, which allows for an easy merge.
				- see example below
	- Step 2: Reverse the last half of the linked list.
		- see [206. Reverse Linked List](206.%20Reverse%20Linked%20List.md)
		- The idea is to keep **three** pointers: `prev, curr, nextt` stand for previous, current and next and change connections in place. Do not forget to use `slow.next = None`, in opposite case you will have list with loop.
	- Step 3: Merge 2 list one by one.
		- see [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](21.%20Merge%20Two%20Sorted%20Lists.md)
		- Finally, we need to merge two lists, given its heads. These heads are denoted by `head`and `prev`, so for simplisity I created `head1` and `head2` variables. What we need to do now is to interchange nodes: we put `head2` as next element of `head1` and then say that `head1` is now `head2` and `head2` is previous `head1.next`. In this way we do one step for one of the lists and rename lists, so next time we will take element from `head2`, then rename again and so on.
- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- do `O(n)` iterations to find middle, then we do `O(n)` iterations to reverse second half and finally we do `O(n)` iterations to merge lists.
	- O(1) space
- note
	- Can someone explain why `slow.next = None` is needed after reversing the second half of the linked list? I don't quite understand how removing it will result in a loop.
		- Without that line, `slow.next` will point to the last node in the _first half_ of the list. This will result in a cycle.
		- ie, the last node of first half list is still directed to the second list. In order to change that we have to set to None, else it will be a cycle.
		- For example, for list `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, `slow.next = None` breaks it into `[1,2,3]` and `[6,5,4]`. Otherwise, we have `[1,2,3,4]` and `[6,5,4]`, which results in a cycle in step 3.



- note: this 'reversing' step is mandatory
	- linked list goes in one direction; this is why the 'reversing' has ot be its own step.
	- aka there's no way to: move a pointer all the way to the end, and then start directly linking stuff from both ends; bc the pointer at the end has no way go backwards
	- !!!!!aka thats why the mid pointer is so important: this is where we start the reversal process



- where the slow and fast pointers end up during the first step:
	- Example:
```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4-> null
s    f
     s         f          
          s             f
```
Here we can see that when it ends, by moving our slow pointer to the second half, we have a split of 0->1->2->null and 3->4->null. We can also imagine in the case of a 4 node linked list, the split would be even: 0->1->null and 2->3->null.
