[206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

# Description
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227105112.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[5,4,3,2,1]`  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240227105133.png)  
**Input:** `head = [1,2]`  
**Output:** `[2,1]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `head = []`  
**Output:** `[]`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# Approaches
### Recursive
```
def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
	if not head:
		return None

	new_head = head
	if head.next:
		new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)
		head.next.next = head
	head.next = None
	return new_head
```
- strategy
	- keep changing the current node next ptr to previous node and traverse through the list. At last, you have set all your pointer to previous node, then return the Tail (prev) as Head
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(n) space
		- for call stack
- cons
	- worse space complexity than iterative, see below
	- have to be careful in other languages, see #languages/order_of_calls



### Iterative
```
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, curr = None, head

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
```



- have 2 pointers while traversing
- Keep the next pointer reference in temp node, and change the current node next ptr to prev node. Keep continuing the process till last node and return last node as a head reference.


- maintain a temporary node, often referred to as a 'dummy' node, which initially points to null, as it will eventually become the tail of the reversed list once all nodes are reversed.

We iterate from the head towards the end of the list, and with each iteration, we do the following:

- Temporarily store the next node (since we are going to disrupt the `next` reference of the current node).
- Set the `next` reference of the current node to point to what is currently the first node of the reversed list (initially, this is `null` or `dummy.next`).
- Move the dummy's next reference to the current node, effectively placing the current node at the beginning of the reversed list.
- Move to the next node in the original list using the reference we stored earlier.

---


We maintain a temporary node inside our loop, to make sure we don't lose track of the next node as we are moving our current node's pointer to the node behind it.

```
0->1->2->null
0<-1  2->null
```

Above we can see, if we don't track our next node from the current, we can easily lose our linked list.

- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space (aka better than recursive approach)
		- only a constant number of pointers (`dummy`, `curr`, `next`) are used
