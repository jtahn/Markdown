# Description
There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0`  
**Output:** `4`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3`  
**Output:** `-1`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1], target = 0`  
**Output:** `-1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

# todo

## to blurb: naming/'style'
- there are certain problems where imo it's appropriate to have it be like a 'table of contents' for further discussions
	- basically the problem is too general/easy/broad, so it's not an example for the subtleties of the technique
- ie
	- binary search
	- 2 pointer (when i find like the most 'basic' version)
		- looking for a problem:
			- basically only 1 obvious way to iterate
			- for that way, there is a very direct way to skip iterations

## assorted
- a lot of the 'geenral binary search' discussion here should be moved to the “binary search”, or other problems



- should i keep modulus trick?
	- the modulus “trick” surely has a one liner explanation
	- (the trick where you can run binary search on entire rotated array) 
	- can be used in the second routine during the “pure binary search” step
	- i think i deleted it; go check commit history for this file to find what was there
		- nvm, seems i just didnt github commit
	- likely simple way to explain is like:
		- shift by pivot
		- then mod by size of array
	- this technique surely will show up in a future fundamental problem...
	- for now, imo seems like a useful trick to be aware of
	- note: this trick is unecessary tbh:
		- once we found the pivot, we can actually determine in O(1) time, two things:
			- whether array is rotated
			- if it is rotated: which subarray contains our target
		- so regardless, it suffices to run binary search once on a sorted subarray



# References
- binary search
	- determine which half to toss
	- exit condition
		- If you change your while condition to lo<=hi, then you will simply need to return just -1 in the end.
			- [704. Binary Search](704.%20Binary%20Search.md)
				- seems maybe one 'benefit' is that: if your comparison is `<=`, then you know that if you exit the while loop, then no solution has been found

# Abstract
- probably none; alrdy abstract enough

## sequence of techniques
- aka combine routines

```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def searchIndexOfMinElement(nums):
			return
        
        def binarySearch(nums, left, right, target):
            return
        
        pivot = searchIndexOfMinElement(nums)
        res = binarySearch(nums, 0, pivot - 1, target)
        if res != -1:
	        return res
	    else:
	        return binarySearch(nums, pivot, len(nums) - 1, target)
```

- strategy
	- Find pivot, then pure binary search on sorted subarrays
	- that is
		- do [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](153.%20Find%20Minimum%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md)
		- then do [704. Binary Search](704.%20Binary%20Search.md) on each of `nums[0,pivot]` and `nums[pivot:]`
- complexity
	- time O(logn), because finding pivot and then doing binary search are both O(logn)


- variant
	- just do pure binary search on entire array, by shifting/modding the index

## binary search
```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid

            # Check if left half is sorted
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if target > nums[mid] or target < nums[l]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:                    # if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
            # Otherwise, right half must be sorted
            else:
                if target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]:
                    r = mid - 1
				else:                    # if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
        return -1



"""bisect"""
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums, target):
        self.__getitem__ = lambda i: \
            (nums[0] <= target) ^ (nums[0] > nums[i]) ^ (target > nums[i])
        i = bisect.bisect_left(self, True, 0, len(nums))
        return i if target in nums[i:i+1] else -1
```

- which half to toss?
	- claim: at least one of the halves will be sorted
		- half without the pivot (ie original min/first value) is guaranteed to be sorted
	- if a half is sorted, its very easy to decide whether to keep or discard
		- if target in range of this (sorted) half: keep this half
		- if not in this (sorted) half: discard
- strategy
	- binary search
		- first find one of the sorted halves
			- note: subarray of rotated sorted array:
				- subarray is sorted IFF `subarray[l] <= subarray[r]`
					- equals sign bc it could be a single element
		- more specifically: pick a half, and determine if it's sorted
		- if sorted:
			- determine if target is within `[subarray[l], subarray[r]]`, and toss one of the halves accordingly
		- if unsorted:
			- then the other half is sorted (bc know at least one of the halves is sorted)
			- so check if target is within bounds of the other half, and toss one of the halves accordingly


- possible errors: `<=` to check if left array is sorted?
	- even tho entries are unique...still might need `nums[l] <= nums[mid]`; bc its possible that l=mid?
		- i don't think so..this only happens when the array is now 2 elements...so it'd just mean you go to the second case...and then probly break out of this loop on the next iteration...
