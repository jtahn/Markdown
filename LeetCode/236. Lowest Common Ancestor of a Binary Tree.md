[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        
```

# Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153239.png)  
**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153247.png)  
**Input:** `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

- https://realpython.com/python-boolean/#other-types-as-boolean-values

#/jargon 
- confirm whether #ad_hoc/overload  is correct #/jargon 
	- different from operator/etc 'overload' in python
- this more similar to 'overload' used in soem matrix problems, where you overwrite vals in the matrix...tho actually tbh, that's not overload..that's just realizing you can 'smartly' overwrite data
	- it becomes overload if like:
		- 'negative number means one thing; else positive number means the actual value we care about'
	- well so then, those problems are combining overwriting AND overload imo?
- here, this is pure 'overload'


#/jargon 
- what do you call the info that parent asks children? aka that children returns to parent call?


#/move
- 235 (this problem) should be where i have the discussion that:
	- LCA is node where both nodes are in the subtrees
- then 236 references this problem
	- and point is, much easier solution bc bst property
		- ie, the solution can now be, 'search with pruning half at each step'
			- which ends up just looking like a traversal
			- !!! oh that's probly a big observation btw!!! that 'search with pruning half' on a binary tree, is really implemented with a traversal
				- i mean...traversal literally IS the strat tbh..bc you 'traverse' search space candidates

- (a lot of my discussion can likely be removed bc of the wiki article; and likely other refs)


#/problems 
- find a list of all the 'important points' of a tree/graph
	- and then find problems that essentially reduce to 'find these points'
		- make sure they're actually problems that would actually be asked in interviews; ie for general cases, sometimes the algos are pretty involved
			- def be AWARE of the general cases + algos
			- but wrt implementation: only need to have full writeups for the cases that would actually be asked
	- example: LCA is a concept, but seems you only expect interviews to ask to find them on binary (search) trees

#/refs

#/strats 
- search for other strats for this specific problem (LCA on binary tree, no parent pointers)

#/meta 
- despite AI, i think these writeups currently have a lot of value
	- many problems:
		- chatgpt is excellent at explaining what the code is doing
		- but not the best at
			- the true inspo behind the solution
			- why the code is 'correct'
			- (and anyways, imo working through these is helping me learn a lot)
	- ie [[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree]]



#/workflow 
- if i'm having trouble trying to figure out the inspo:
	- try to identify all the jargon that could describe the code
		- tbh, chatgpt can be good for this
	- and also, break down all the jargon/routine/etc into steps
		- chatgpt also good for this
	- then figure out correct order/dependencies of ALL the steps/jargon together
	- then finding the 'inspo' is probly about:
		- what do you need to fill in before the first step
		- what do you need to fill in between steps
- example: trying to find inspo for [[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree]]
	- i realized that 'post-order traversal' and 'recursion+propagate' were key jargon
		- and in particular, post-order comes before recursion+propagate (bc the latter is how you need to implement the former)
	- so then i realized: a key step in inspo will be to explain how we realize we need a 'post-order traversal'
		- and/or: it's really 'post-order' that we need to explain; NOT recursion
		- bc the recursion follows immediately, once we understand why we need post-order
	- and eventually, this made me realize:
		- recursion+propagate really is the same thing as 'post order traversal', bc post order only applies to trees, and bc no parent pointers: you basically 'should' implement via recursion + propagate anyways
			- it's not just that iterative post-order is trickier to implement, especially since the children need to propagate info back to parents (so actually, yabe iterative is impossible?)
			- also a 'recursion/propagate' tag seems useless, bc basically every recursion algo will propagate info back to the call...that's like the whole point of recursion
		- once i realized it was post order, then i realized the 'true inspo' is understanding:
			- other than the solution, what info needs to be communicated btwn parent/children and this node
			- which also helped me realize: the 'recursive' solutions were using a #ad_hoc/overload 'optimization'

- for arbitrary trees/DAGs, this problem has a bunch of algos that seem pretty involved
	- but for binary (search) trees, there are very simple algos


## #trees/no_pointers_to_parent
- apparently: should not assume that trees have pointers to parents
	- https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs
		- looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about "the parent node" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Nodes_and_references
		- In a language with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node.
	- https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html
		- A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element. The topmost node in the tree is called the root.
- this means, when you're given a problem:
	- check the provided code, they'll usually tell you how the tree is implemented
	- ie look for the `TreeNode` class
	- so if there's no reference to parent, then you need to make sure your strat either doesn't use it; or you need to allocate space complexity to store this (and possibly time complexity, to compute parents)




## assorted basics
- #trees/base_case_is_null
	- ie, is often null
	- (btw, this doesn't really apply to graphs; it applies to trees bc typical implementation is, you always have pointers to the children)
- #python/tricks/multiple_equality
	- if you are checking for equality with multiple objects:
		- instead of chaining equality checks with `or`: just convert it to `if x in tuple`
- #trees/traversal/post-order
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first_search

- #python/tricks/conditional_execution
	- in non-boolean context, `or` and `and` return truthy/falsy objects; NOT the booleans true/false
		- in particular, this means they can be used for conditional execution

	- thus, `return left or right` is equivalent to:
```python
if left:
	return left
else:
	return right
```

		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)
		- On the other hand, if you try to use conditions that involve Boolean operators like [`or`](https://realpython.com/python-or-operator/) and [`and`](https://realpython.com/python-keywords/#operator-keywords-and-or-not-in-is) in the way you saw before, then your predicate functions won’t work correctly. That’s because these operators behave differently. They return one of the operands in the condition rather than `True` or `False`
	- https://realpython.com/python-or-operator/#using-or-with-common-objects
		- If the operands involved in an `or` operation are objects instead of Boolean expressions, then the Python `or` operator returns a true or false object, not the values `True` or `False` as you could expect. The truth value of this object is determined according to the rules you’ve seen before.
	- https://realpython.com/python-keywords/#operator-keywords-and-or-not-in-is
	- https://realpython.com/python-and-operator/#using-pythons-and-operator-in-non-boolean-contexts
		- The fact that `and` can return objects besides just `True` and `False` is an interesting feature. For example, this feature allows you to use the `and` operator for **conditional execution**.




#/style 
- tags should denote some kind of general fundy
	- but do so in a way that is as 'descriptive' as possible
	- so that, for problems that use that tag 'directly': i can just list the tag, and immediately understand how it applies
- so then: one of the reference headers can just be like, 'list of assorted basics used in direct/straightword/immediate ways' (find better jargon)
	- maybe don't even have a header/name for this; just immediately list these under 'references'
	- and then only have subheadings for references that require some extra discussion



## #trees/traversal/post-order 


- post order traversal required if:
	- node needs to compute something based on children
	- also: out of the 3 types of dfs traversals, post-order is is trickiest to implement iteratively
		- bc in a tree, cannot assume pointers to parent
		- also i'm not even sure if you can use iterative here? bc you need to propagate info back up to parents
			- i'm sure you could use some aux data structures, but wouldnt this be more space inefficient than recursive, if you did it naively?
		- (figure out above)
			- via problem 145
		- the summary for now is just: if post-order, then just do recursion


- here: 
	- node asks children:
		- if p or q is a descendant
			- if both children say yes (which means, each child found one)
				- then this node is the LCA
			- if only one child:
				- then propagate the p or q info
				- aka we are telling parent that p/q is in this subtree
					- aka is their descendant
		- if it has found the LCA
			- then propagate the LCA to parent
	- descendant info gets computed when:
		- if it is p or q, then immediately return itself
		- if it is null, then return null
	- LCA gets computed when:
		- explicitly when a node gets non-null descendant info from both children
		- and then gets propagated up
	- the special case is when wlog p is ancestor of q
		- this means the initial/root call should have a conditional at the end, to check if LCA was ever explicitly found
			- aka if it ever received LCA from children
			- if not: then the descendant info is actually the LCA, so return that



## #ad_hoc/overload


- optimization:
	- can actually combine these 2 'info' into 1
	- nodes will return either a node or null
		- node will be one of p, q, or LCA (which could also be p,q)
	- visiting a node:
		- if we get both p and q from children, then we know this node is answer
		- if only 1 child returned a node, then just return this node
			- bc it combines the cases where:
				- we're propagating the answer
				- we're propagating that p/q is a descendant (by returning p/q)
	
	
- the case where p/q is the ancestor of the other, is taken care of:
	- bc wlog p is the only node that will be propagated up




# Strategies


## post-order traversal

- - [L27. Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree | LCA | C++ | Java - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-QHfMDde90)


- complexity
	- O(n) time
		- worst-case scenario, the code will have to visit each node once
	- O(h) space
		- dfs recursion, so space complexity is call stack, aka height
		- worst case h=n, if skewed tree


```python
# no overload



# overload
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: "TreeNode", p: "TreeNode", q: "TreeNode") -> "TreeNode":
        if root in (None, p, q):
            return root
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

		if left and right:
			return root
        return left or right
```





## aware: other/faster algos for related structures
- in particular, if we have parent pointers: there is an O(h) time algo
	- https://stackoverflow.com/a/1484810
		- (this might just be a simplified version of famous LCA algos on general trees)
	- which would mean: if you need to perform this operation many times, then it could be worth pre-processing by adding parent pointers
