[438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        
```

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices of_ `p`_'s anagrams in_ `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"`  
**Output:** `[0,6]`  
**Explanation:**  
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".  
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "abab", p = "ab"`  
**Output:** `[0,1,2]`  
**Explanation:**  
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".  
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".  
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

- there's definitely at least a few optimizations here, check past string problems:
	- better space: only need 1 counter that we do 'inverse increment/decrements' over
	- better time: using an int that essentially tracks number of matched counts
		- so that checking whether we have an anagram boils down to an equality on an int, rather than on a hashmap

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/solutions/639309/java-python-sliding-window-detail-explanation-clean-concise/
	- this also seems like a very elegant optimization for time, that is not exactly the same as the time optimization above

- #meta maybe rename this tag to #rolling or 'iteration/rolling'
	- bc the classic example of this is rabin-karp, and 'rolling' is the jargon used there

# Strategies


## #sliding_window + rolling
- basically rabin-karp, but hashmap instead of a hash
	- so we don't have to write our own hash function
