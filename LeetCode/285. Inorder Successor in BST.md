[285. Inorder Successor in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def inorderSuccessor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
	    
```

# Description

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420014231.png)  
**Input:** `root = [2,1,3], p = 1`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420014242.png)  
**Input:** `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6`  
**Output:** `null`  
**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- All Nodes will have unique values.

#/jargon 
- what do u call implementation that isn't 'recursive function calls', but basically same recursive idea?
	- 'loop'? 'iterative'?

- what do u call strat that is really just, 'do you know definition/property of the structure'?
	- actually, this is never a strat though...or at least, literally every problem involves this
	- example: [[285. Inorder Successor in BST]]
		- originally, i thought the strat idea was just: 'do u know data structure def/props'
		- but now i realize it's actually:
			- you use the defs/props to figure out how to prune the search space

## #trees/bst 
- bst property
- iirc 'in-order successor' is std jargon for 'node with next value'
	- in particular:
		- node with highest value IFF no in-order successor


- btw, does successor need to be strictly greater?
	- here, doesnt matter bc all unique nodes

## #trees/traversal 


### incorrect inspo
- this problem seems really just: do you know how to implement an inorder traversal?
	- bc then solution is just, find the next node in the traversal

- actually no it's not; the above is an interpretation of how to do it, but definitely inefficient
	- bc there's no need to do the full traversal
	- so this problem is like, do the shortcut
		- how the properties of a binary search tree can streamline our search for the successor node


- probly:
	- this problem:
		- you first should understand how to do an inorder traversal on bst
		- then it becomes 'obvi' how to streamline the traversal for our solution
	- specifically:
		- The in-order traversal for a BST involves visiting the left subtree, then the node itself, and then the right subtree
		- so to streamline:
			- if `p` has a right subtree
				- then the successor would be the leftmost node in that right subtree
			- else (aka `p` does not have a right subtree)
				- the successor would be one of its ancestors, specifically the one for whom `p` is situated in the left subtree.

### why above incorrect, below correct
- ehhh actually...i think about are correct, but not the true inspo
- the true inspo is like one of the observations i had in a different problem...where we use the fact that we're traversing from root...see below
	- oh so then this really is just like:
		- 'traversing search space, with pruning'
		- !!! yes
	- !! go find that problem..or when i encounter it, realize that the strat is probably exactly the same: it's just 'search and prune'
- wait this seems so obvious in hindsight:
	- if the problem is asking you to 'find element':
		- then a standard approach is:
			- 'traverse search space and prune'



### correct inspo (traverse/search and prune)
- comparison to decide which subtree to traverse
	- aka direction of search
	- we compare with the node, not it's children
	- if curr > p: no point searching curr's right subtree
		- bc those vals are geq curr, so we won't find a better candidate than curr
		- so search curr's left
	- conversely, if curr < p:
		- no point searching curr's left subtree
		- bc those vals are are leq curr, so none are valid successors

- key point:
	- why we never have to go upwards again?
		- or save all nodes along path?
	- maybe:
		- observe that the conditionals above mean that we can discard remaining half of the tree in each step
		- the actual traversal path also discards/processes candidates along that path
			- updating or not: means we always discard either the current best, or current node


# Strategies


## traverse/search and prune

- complexity
	- O(h) time
		- means that in the worst case scenario (a skewed tree), where the tree shape resembles a linked list, the algorithm could take O(n) time where n is the number of nodes, since the tree's height would be equivalent to the number of nodes
	- O(1) space

                root = root.left
