[13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `s = "III"`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `III = 3.`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `s = "LVIII"`  
**Output:** `58`  
**Explanation:** `L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `s = "MCMXCIV"`  
**Output:** `1994`  
**Explanation:** `M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

- this is not a 'math' problem
- see below, imo feels more like very simple #strings/parsing

## reverse iteration
- complexity
	- time O(n)
	- space
		- O(1) for dict

```python
class Solution:
12    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
13        d = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
14        total, prev_value = 0, 0
15        for char in reversed(s):
16            if d[char] < prev_value:
17                total -= d[char]
18            else:
19                total += d[char]
20            prev_value = d[char]
21        return total
```

# reverse iteration
class Solution:
2    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
4        roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}

7        previous_number = roman_to_int[s[-1]]
10        total = previous_number
11      
13        for i in range(len(s) - 2, -1, -1):
15            current_number = roman_to_int[s[i]]
19            if current_number < previous_number:
20                total -= current_number
21            else:
22                total += current_number
25            previous_number = current_number

## forward iteration
### pairwise

first create a mapping of Roman numeral symbols to their respective integer values. This allows for easy lookup during the conversion

iterate over the string from left to right, checking the value of each symbol in comparison to the symbol to its right.


If a symbol is followed by one of greater value, it means we need to subtract the value of the current symbol from our result. Otherwise, we can simply add the value of the symbol. This adheres to the subtraction rule given for cases like IV or IX
- i think the fact that string is valid, means that this simple comparison is all you need
- ie don't need more complicated logic for each of the 6 cases outlined in problem description

- !! imo i think a key thing here is understanding why this algo can be so simple
	- ie dont need some kind of more complicated 'backtracking' algo or something
	- i think it's just because: determining what to do at an element, all you need is the next element
	- so you can just do this in one pass, with 1 char of lookahead
	- this reminds me of parsing problems #strings/parsing 

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.pairwise
	- Return successive overlapping pairs taken from the input _iterable_.
	- The number of 2-tuples in the output iterator will be one fewer than the number of inputs. It will be empty if the input iterable has fewer than two values.


we can take advantage of the pairwise utility from the `itertools` module, which will give us each symbol and the one following it.


we iterate over the string one character at a time, examining the symbol and the one that follows it (this is the pairwise comparison). For this task, we use a for loop in conjunction with the Python generator expression format. To demonstrate, we generate tuples of (current character `a`, next character `b`) using the pairwise utility


1. As the pairwise comparison does not include the very last symbol in the computation, we correct for this by adding `d[s[-1]]` to the total sum to include the value of the last symbol.

```python
class Solution:
2    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
3        d = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
4        total = sum((-1 if d[a] < d[b] else 1) * d[a] for a, b in pairwise(s)) + d[s[-1]]
5        return total
```
