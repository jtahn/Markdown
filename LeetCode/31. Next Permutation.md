```

# Description

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
**Output:** `[1,3,2]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [3,2,1]`  
**Output:** `[1,2,3]`  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `nums = [1,1,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,5,1]`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

#/move 
- this is not a recursion problem
	- even if there is a 'good' recursive algo...the meat of the problem is narayana's observation...not 'recursion'




#/style 
- there are often problems where:
	- i just need to know the 'definition' of something, but it's not really related to the strat/implementation
	- or the strat is just a very adhoc observation about the definition
		- (ie here imo, for the non-recursive solution)

- so maybe i should have a (sub)heading 'definitions'/'jargon' where i just list all the tags for the necessary definitions, in case someone wants to quickly review
- and for strats that are 'adhoc on definition'...do i put this under the 'adhoc' heading/tag?
	- this kind of tag seems useless, bc i'll just have so many completely unrelated things under it
	- maybe 'adhoc' should just be a subtag for the 'definition tag' that i used
	- and over time, if i notice that a lot of the adhoc subtag stuff is similar...then i convert it into a named subtag

- imo the 'adhoc' observation isn't actually adhoc
	- c++ actually has a standard function that implements this
		- https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation
		- https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/next_permutation/
	- so they must think its actually important
	- yea, seems like it's an important algo for workign with perms
