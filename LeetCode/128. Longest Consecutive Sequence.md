[128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`  
**Output:** `9`  

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# todo
- figure out why set/dict lookup is O(1), and then move it to whatever problem is 'fundamental problem' for sets/dict

# sorting (not allowed)
- strategy
	- sort array
	- iterate through array
		- keep track of
			- length of current sequence
			- length of longest sequence
		- reset current length if current entry is not +1 of previous entry
- not allowed bc time complexity of any sorting algo is above O(n)
	- ie at least O(N log n)

# brute force
- for each node, figure out what the longest consecutive subseq containing it is
	- aka repeatedly check x-1 to see how left it extends
		- ie whether x-1 is in the array
	- then repeatedly check x+1 to see how right it extends
- complexity will be poor: bc for every node: (aka count n)
	- you check if the next neighbor exist
		- each existence check, aka iterating through an unsorted array, is O(n)
		- there are up to n consecutive neighbors
	- so this is O(n^3) time


# hashing (set)
```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for n in numSet:
            # check if its the start of a sequence
            if (n - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (n + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        return longest
```
- observations
	- use a set to efficiently check if adjacent nodes (ie x-1 or x+1) are in the array
		- populate a set with array elements, takes O(n) time
		- with a reasonable hashing function, then membership testing is O(1)
			- check if this is amortized O(1) or true O(1)
		- this means that: if you have a node, you can easily use this set to fill out the full consecutive subsequence that contains it (by checking x-1 and x+1 repeatedly until they fail)...however this leads to the second key idea: you dont actually want to iterate over ever node, and for every node, 'fill out the full subseq'...bc then you're just repeating a lot of work.
		- note: this observation alone is not enough; ie if the entire array is a streak, then you still have O(n^2) time, bc for each node, you traverse the entire array
			- how do we avoid traversing streaks multiple times? see next observation...
	- explore each streak only once
		- streaks are disjoint; so each node can be 'assigned' to a unique streak; how do we explore each streak only once?
			- disjoint sets; ie connected components;
		- 2 options
			- use another set to determine if you have already incorporated this node as part of a streak
				- ie set telling you which nodes have already been added as neighbors when you were iterating over a previous node; so no need to build out the subseq for this node, bc its already been computed
			- only explore a streak when you are with a starting/left-most node
				- aka use defining property of starting node of a subsequence: that x-1 doesnt exist in the set
				- also for starting nodes: only need to do a 'forwards progression' (ie repeatedly checking if x+1 exists) to fully explore the streak
- strategy
	- first pass to populate a set with `nums`
	- second pass
		- for each node
			- if it is the start of a sequence, then see how far it extends
- optimization:
	- for the second pass: loop through the set, not through `nums`
- complexity
	- time O(n)
		- it's true the second pass is a 'double loop', but observe that it can only visit the elements of `nums` at most twice
			- for every node where we decide to 'extend its subsequence': then this node will not be visited when we "extend" a different subsequence
		- better explanation: we explore each streak only once; the sum of the nodes of the streaks is O(n)
	- space O(n)
		- for the set

## todo: confirming that set lookup is O(1)
- ie that set lookup is O(1)

seems: so complexity worst case isnt O(n);
but point is this essentially wont happen (ie probability 0)

confirm that it's not 'amortized' O(n); it's just pure O(n) with probability 100 (ie almost everywhere)
