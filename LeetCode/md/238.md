https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is equal to the product of all the elements of_ `nums` _except_ `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
**Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# Brute force

- for each entry, just loop through the other entries to compute a product, and then store the value
- O(n^2) time
- O(n) space
	- to store the products (bc can't delete the og entry; need it to compute the products associated with other entries)




# Dynamic programming
- observation: can't use division. ie this strategy won't work:
	- find product of all numbers
	- then for each entry: divide full product by that entry
	- doesn't work if an entry is 0
- complexity
	- O(N) bc iterate through the array thrice
	- O(N) to store left/prefix and right/suffix/postfix products







2 ways to do design the left/right arrays: can omit the entry in the products that share the same index:

or keep it:

(doesn't matter what you choose, just make sure that when you finally create the products, it aligns with how you designed the left/right arrays)

## optimization
- (unecessary imo)
	- lots of ppl say this is O(1) space..imo i'm pretty sure this is wrong; just bc the extra created array is what you will return..just seems very odd this is considered O(1) space, bc you still have the old array in memory... ie this isn't in place
- observation: we don't need both the left and right array
- strategy
	- construct the left array
	- then compute results by iterating backwards
