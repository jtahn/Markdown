# Brute force

- for each entry, just loop through the other entries to compute a product, and then store the value
- O(n^2) time
- O(n) space
	- to store the products (bc can't delete the og entry; need it to compute the products associated with other entries)




# Dynamic programming
- observation: can't use division. ie this strategy won't work:
	- find product of all numbers
	- then for each entry: divide full product by that entry
	- doesn't work if an entry is 0
- complexity
	- O(N) bc iterate through the array thrice
	- O(N) to store left/prefix and right/suffix/postfix products







2 ways to do design the left/right arrays: can omit the entry in the products that share the same index:

or keep it:

(doesn't matter what you choose, just make sure that when you finally create the products, it aligns with how you designed the left/right arrays)

## optimization
- (unecessary imo)
	- lots of ppl say this is O(1) space..imo i'm pretty sure this is wrong; just bc the extra created array is what you will return..just seems very odd this is considered O(1) space, bc you still have the old array in memory... ie this isn't in place
- observation: we don't need both the left and right array
- strategy
	- construct the left array
	- then compute results by iterating backwards

# second optim
- can do this in a single pass
