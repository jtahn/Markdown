Implement the `MyQueue` class using only two stacks. The class should support all the functions of a normal FIFO queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only  `push to top` ,  `peek/pop from top` ,  `size` , and  `is empty`  operations are valid
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
- $1 \leq x \leq 9$ 
- At most 100 calls will be made to  `push` ,  `pop` ,  `peek` , and  `empty` .
- All the calls to  `pop`  and  `peek`  are valid.

More specific implementations details for the  `MyQueue`  class:
- `void push(int x)`  pushes element  `x`  to the back of the queue
- `int pop()`  removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it
- `int peek()`  returns the element at the front of the queue
- `boolean empty()`  returns  `true`  if the queue is empty,  `false`  otherwise
