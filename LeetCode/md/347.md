- strategy  
	- compute and store counts   
		- Counter   
		- dictionary   
		- can't use an array, there's no bounds on what the entries could be   
	- then determine elements corresp to k most frequent counts   
		- bucket sort   
		- build max heap, pop k times   
		- build and stream through a size-k min heap   
		- quick select  
- python tips  
	- be aware of:    
		- Counter.most_common()   
		- heapq.nlargest()  
	- for max heap: need to invert the counts, bc heapq module implements a min heap
