https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return _its root_.




**Example 1:**
![](../../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220340.png)
**Input:** `root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]`
**Output:** `[4,7,2,9,6,3,1]`

**Example 2:**
![](../../!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240224220351.png)
**Input:** `root = [2,1,3]`
**Output:** `[2,3,1]`

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `root = []`
**Output:** `[]`



**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

# non-recursive DFS/BFS
- strategy
	- pop node in stack/queue
	- invert the children
	- add children to the stack/queue

- common errors
	- Forgetting "if node"
# recursive DFS
- strategy
	- observe that this function takes the root as input, and needs to return it as output as well.
	- so then the body of the function should just invert the children, and also call itself on the children as well
	- and you can save lines by realizing that the call on children also returns the children
- commons errors
	- forgetting "if root"
