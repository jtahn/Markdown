Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

# Brute Force
- strategy
	- Check every pair of numbers for equality (for each value, check if a later value is equal).
 - O(n^2) time
 - O(1) space


# Sorting
strategy
Sort array
Then check each pair of adjacent values for equality.
complexity depends on the sorting algo


# Hashing
- strategy
	- Iterate through the array, using a set/hashmap to check whether a number has already been encountered.
- O(n) time
- O(n) space
