Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.  
  

- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters

# Sorting
- strategy
	- Sort, then compare for equality.
- complexity depends on the sorting algo


# Hashing
- strategy
	- iterate through each string and store counts
		- can use dictionary or array
	- compare counts.
- python
	- oneliner via Counter class
- $O(n)$ time
	- iterate through each string once to compute counts
	- iterate through count structures to compare
-  $O(1)$ space
	- 2 structures, each of size at most 26
