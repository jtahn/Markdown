Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
  
- assume that each input would have exactly one solution
- you may not use the same element twice
- you can return the answer in any order

# Brute-force search
- strategy
	- check all pairs, count $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}=O(n^2)$
- O(n^2)  time
- O(1)  space

# Hashing
- observation
	- use dictionaries to store bijections/inverses/pairs. specifically:
		- dictionary = {number: its index in the array}
- strategy
	- for num in nums:
		- check dictionary to see if `target-num` has been encountered (aka is a key)
		- if not, store `num:index` in the dictionary
- O(n)  time and space
