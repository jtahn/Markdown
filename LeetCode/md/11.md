https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.



**Example 1:**
**Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
**Output:** `49`
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `height = [1,1]`
**Output:** `1`




**Constraints:**
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

# Observations
- formula for area

# Brute force
- strategy
	- check area for all pairs
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- O(1) space
	- 


# Two pointer

```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        res = 0

        while l < r:
            res = max(res, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            elif height[r] <= height[l]:
                r -= 1
            
        return res
```

- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space
- optimizations
	- when we move the shorter pointer (aka the min of the two pointers): keep incrementing it until it hits a taller value than the og value it was at (bc if its not strictly taller, then alrdy know area will be strictly smalle)
