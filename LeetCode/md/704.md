Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.


- all the integers in  `nums`  are unique

# binary search
- compare an element in the middle of the array with the target value  
- If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned  
- If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array  
- If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.  
  
diagram: ``[i .... m-1] [m] [m+1 ...... j] `
so either return m or adjust i or j



---

- avoiding overflow errors: instead of (i+j)//2, do i + (j-i)//2
    - though this likely is now computing ceiling of (i+j)/2

- leave out the middle comparison: results in a faster comparison loop.
but: thing to keep in mind here, is which direction you're rounding in your integer division:

if this operator rounds down,
then the comparison inside MUST be val < target.
because look small case, adjacent indicies i and j.
so array we've narrowed down to, it looks like
`[i j]`
then computing m, this is equivalent to `[m   m+1]`
thus the comparison needs to result in either:
i = m+1
or j = m
which means comparison needs to be val < target
NOT val <= target
the latter requires i = m or j = m-1
else the while loop doesn't terminate, bc you are permanently stuck on the array 
`[i j] = [i   i+1] = [m   m+1]`
