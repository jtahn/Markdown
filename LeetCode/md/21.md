https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.



**Example 1:**
**Input:** `list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]`
**Output:** `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `list1 = [], list2 = []`
**Output:** `[]`

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `list1 = [], list2 = [0]`
**Output:** `[0]`



**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

# Recursion
- strategy
	- observe this function needs to return the node that comes first; wlog head1.
	- so recursion step: point head1 to the output of function(head1.next, head2)
- optimization
	- remember: base case: if one of the heads is none, return the non-trivial head (if it exists) (else return none)
- complexity
	- optimal time



# iterative
- complexity
	- optimal time
- pseudocode
	- to build the new merged list:
		- while both heads are nontrivial:
			- (wlog head1<head2)
			- link head1 to the new merged list,
			- set head1 = head1.next
- what if one of the heads is empty?
- optimizations
	- trick for cleaner/shorter code: make sure `list1.val <= list2.val` before i do anything important
	- aka this is what is meant by "wlog"
- common errors
	- function(a,b) instead of self.function(a,b)
