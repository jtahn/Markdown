Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.




**Example 1:**
**Input:** 
```
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:** `true`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** 
```
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.




**Constraints:**
- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

## checking rows, columns, and 3x3 separately

according to realpython, map is falling out of favor now..try to use generator expressions and comprehensions...


"using zip to transpose": ie so that rows of the transpose are columns of og puzzle

"generator to yield blocks": to check each 3x3 block

"bit memoization to check for unique digits": go understand the map(), >>, and &
