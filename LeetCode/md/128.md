https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
**Output:** `4`
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
**Output:** `9`


**Constraints:**
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# sorting (not allowed)
- strategy
	- sort array
	- iterate through array
		- keep track of
			- length of current sequence
			- length of longest sequence
		- reset current length if current entry is not +1 of previous entry
- not allowed bc time complexity of any sorting algo is above O(n)
	- ie at least O(N log n)
- O(1) space

# brute force


- for each node, figure out what the longest consecutive subseq containing it is
	- aka repeatedly check x-1 to see how left it extends
		- ie whether x-1 is in the array
	- then repeatedly check x+1 to see how right it extends
- complexity will be poor: bc for every node: (aka count n)
	- you check if the next neighbor exist
		- each existence check, aka iterating through an unsorted array, is O(n)
		- there are up to n consecutive neighbors
	- so this is O(n^3) time


# hashing (set)

- 2 key ideas here to improve upon brute force
	- use a set to efficiently check if adjacent nodes (ie x-1 or x+1) are in the array
		- populate a set with array elements, takes O(n) time
		- with a reasonable hashing function, then membership testing is O(1)
			- check if this is amortized O(1) or true O(1)
		- this means that: if you have a node, you can easily use this set to fill out the full consecutive subsequence that contains it (by checking x-1 and x+1 repeatedly until they fail)...however this leads to the second key idea: you dont actually want to iterate over ever node, and for every node, 'fill out the full subseq'...bc then you're just repeating a lot of work.
	- aka big idea 2: figure out a way to 'assemble'/'build' each consecutive disjoint subsequence only once
		- either use another set to determine if you have already incorporated this node as part of a consecutive subsequence
			- ie set telling you which nodes have already been added as neighbors when you were iterating over a previous node; so no need to build out the subseq for this node, bc its already been computed
		- only 'fill out subseq' when you are with a starting/left node of a subseq
			- aka using defining property of starting node of a subsequence: that x-1 doesnt exist in the set
			- aka you smartly iterate the array by only doing a 'forwards progression' (ie repeatedly checking if x+1) if you know that a number is the start of a new sequence
				- aka if x-1 is not present in the set
				- if x-1 is present in the set, then you just dont check for a sequence here; bc you will find this sequence later when your iteration hits x-1 (or maybe even further back)
- optimization:

the second big idea is important!
ie just having the hashset foor lookups isnt enough: you need the second idea, which means you dont keep rechecking sequences

btw, terminology:

- consecutive sequence ie connected component ie disjoint set
- aka problem is: find largest connected component
- apparently another idea
	- create a disjoint-set data structure out of the array elements...





## confirming that time is O(n)

seems: so complexity worst case isnt O(n);
but point is this essentially wont happen (ie probability 0)

confirm that it's not 'amortized' O(n); it's just pure O(n) with probability 100 (ie almost everywhere)
