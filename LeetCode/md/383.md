https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` _if_ `ransomNote` _can be constructed by using the letters from_ `magazine` _and_ `false` _otherwise_.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.



**Example 1:**
**Input:** `ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"`
**Output:** `false`

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"`
**Output:** `false`

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"`
**Output:** `true`



**Constraints:**
- `1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 10^5`
- `ransomNote` and `magazine` consist of lowercase English letters.

# Store counts
- idea
	- use a dictionary or an array to store counts
	- if you use an array `v`:
		- counts for char `c`, can be stored at something like `v[c - 'a']`
			- aka subtracting the char `'a'`
		- some languages: performing math ops with ascii chars will return the answer wrt corresp int values,  which can now be used as indices 0-26; since in ascii, the letters a-z corresp to a consecutive range of int values
		- other languages: might need to wrap with operators
- strategy
	- create and fill structure with counts
	- compare counts
- python tips
	- can just use `Counter` class
		- Counter class has a variety of tricks that let you compare counts
	- if you don't use Counter class: when filling structure with counts: can iterate through any of:
		- `ransomNote`
		- `set(ransomNote)`
		- `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`
			- in general, faster than above two
		- `string.ascii_lowercase`
			- apparently more reliable/safer than the above?
- complexity
	- O(m+n) time where m and n are lengths of the strings, because you iterate through them
	- O(1) space bc there's only 26 letters; so storing counts is at most size 52, if i store for both strings
- alternative
	- build counts for magazine; then 'decrement' counts as you iterate through note
- at least 3 ways to compare Counter:

# Traversal
- strategy
	- sort strings and do a traversal: you traverse the magazine, and you advance on the note if you get matching letters
	- complexity depends on sorting algo
