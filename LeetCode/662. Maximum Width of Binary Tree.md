```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153537.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (`5,3,null,9`).  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153546.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]`  
**Output:** `7`  
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (`6,null,null,null,null,null,7`).  

**Example 3:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240426153555.png)  
**Input:** `root = [1,3,2,5]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (`3,2`).

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

#/problems 
- find a problem that uses the more 'naive' (standard?) interpretation of what the width of a tree is
	- bc for some reason, this problem counts null nodes on a level...
	- hmm maybe it doesn't exist...seems 'width' is not actually an official used in tree theory
		- #/research 
	- and then for that problem, some ideas:
		- #/strats 
			- wouldn't dfs be more space efficienct? bc you store
				- O(h) for stack
				- O(h) for structure to help compute counts at each level
			- versus bfs is O(n) space...
		- #/strats 
			- is there not a dfs strat that coudl just:
			- track depth of a node, and then counter for num nodes at each level?

#/jargon 
- i need a tag for 'optimizations' that are likely pointless
	- this kind of thing could be interpreted as a 'refactoring' type card; ie trying to understand a code snippet that someone wrote for 'efficiency
	- but tbh, i think i kind of want to have these in my repo (as well, or maybe just everything)
	- ie #python/bitwise/shift 

#python/bitwise/shift
- https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/#bitwise-shift-operators
	- popular **optimization** technique because bit shifting is a single instruction and is cheaper to calculate than exponent or product. Today, however, compilers and interpreters, including Python’s, are quite capable of optimizing your code behind the scenes.
	- Don’t use the bit shift operators as a means of premature optimization in Python. You won’t see a difference in execution speed, but you’ll most definitely make your code less readable.
- summary: be aware of what these are, but don't use them:
	- `i << 1` (equivalent to `2*i`)
	- `i << 1 | 1` (equivalent to `2*i+1`)

## #trees/complete 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees
	- A **complete** binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, _except possibly the last_, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and `2^h` nodes at the last level h.
	- A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using an array.
- https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/completeBinaryTree.html
	- _A complete binary tree has 2k nodes at every [_depth_](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/depth.html) k < n and between 2n and 2n+1-1 nodes altogether. It can be efficiently implemented as an [_array_](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/array.html), where a node at index i has children at indexes 2i and 2i+1 and a parent at index i/2, with [_1-based indexing_](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html). If child index is greater than the number of nodes, the child does not exist._

- so here:
	- the key here is that, because we count null nodes: we need to manually assign indices for nodes, as if it were part of a complete binary tree
	- as stated above, very straightforward to do this with 1-based indexing


- then the width of a level:
	- it's based on the ACTUAL nodes present on that level
	- difference btwn the first and last ACTUAL nodes on that level, plus 1 (to account for the first node)
	- if you have the entire level, then this is trivial to compute
		- aka for bfs: this just means first and last nodes in the queue
	- for 'arbitrary' node, this is trickier..aka dfs strat...see below




## #polya/local_vs_global

( #/jargon)


- suppose you want to use dfs (for space optimization)
- this problem is basically asking us to compute 'global info on a level'
- issue is that in dfs: only 1 node will have 'global info'
	- if dfs with left child first: then only leftmost node knows that it is leftmost
	- all other nodes only have 'local info', bc they dont know if they're the right most child


- use aux structure that saves the first index you visit when you first explore a depth
	- since dfs explores depths in order, can just use size of this structure to determine whether you've explored this depth yet
	- if your dfs explores left before right, then this structures saves all the leftmost nodes on each level


- observe here:
	- the 2 sets of 'global' info (leftmost and rightmost nodes) are enough to compute solution
- so strat:
	- run dfs twice:
		- 'left child first' finds all the leftmost nodes
		- 'right child first' finds all the rightmost nodes
	- then go through your saved distances and subtract
- same complexity as the next dfs strat, but worse time constant bc 2 traversals




## #problem_solving/solution_is_extreme_value 

- !!! (imo this problem is a really interesting/subtle demonstration of this concept)
	- !!!! bc the both dfs strats are actually both applications of this
	- 2 passes: we're taking: extreme over 'level widths'
	- 1 pass: extreme over 'distances'




- local info can compute global info, if you maintain running max
- aka 'search space'/'extreme value' strat/interpretation
	- aka define 'distance'/'value' generated by each node
	- answer is max over these 'values'

- importantly:
	- the first explored node on a level is the leftmost node
- so every other node on that level can compute its 'distance' from the leftmost node, as long as it knows its depth
	- aka extra 'info' ( #/jargon) to pass btw nodes: depths
		- aka addition parameter of dfs fucntion
		- as well as the 'virtual index'
- answer is just the max distance encountered



# Strategies


## max over level widths

- bfs complexity
	- O(n) time
		- visit each node once
	- O(n) space
		- depends on the maximum size of the queue used to store nodes at any level of the tree
		- worst case, when the tree is a complete binary tree: max width is last level
		- aka approximately `N/2` nodes


```python
# bfs
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        q = deque([(root, 1)])
        while q:
            ans = max(ans, q[-1][1] - q[0][1] + 1)
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node, i = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append((node.left, 2*i))
                if node.right:
                    q.append((node.right, 2*i+1))
        return ans
```

## max over 'distances'

```python
# dfs, recursive
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def dfs(root, depth, i):
            if root is None:
                return
            if len(t) == depth:
                t.append(i)
            else:
                nonlocal ans
                ans = max(ans, i - t[depth] + 1)
            dfs(root.left, depth + 1, i << 1)
            dfs(root.right, depth + 1, i << 1 | 1)

        ans = 1
        t = []
        dfs(root, 0, 1)
        return ans
```
