[167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_ `index1` _and_ `index2`_, **added by one** as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, `index_1 = 1`, `index_2 = 2`. We return `[1, 2]`.  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6`  
**Output:** `[1,3]`  
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore `index_1 = 1`, `index_2 = 3`. We return `[1, 3]`.  

**Example 3:**  
**Input:** `numbers = [-1,0], target = -1`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`  
**Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore `index_1 = 1`, `index_2 = 2`. We return `[1, 2]`.  

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

# todo
- in problem description, why is “1-indexed” bolded?
	- there might be a definition i should paste here
- hashing approach is technically O(1) because of the constraints
	- but doesnt seem to be spirit of the problem




# brute force
- check all pairs
- complexity
	- O(n^2) time
	- O(1) space

# binary search
- we know it's sorted
- so for each node:
	- binary search on rest of the array (ie right subarray) to see if its pair exists
		- no need to check left subarray, bc we wouldve alrdy found it when we iterated on that node
- complexity
	- O(nlogn) time
	- O(1) space

# hashing
- keep track of encountered nodes
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space because of the constraint that numbers have max size 1000
		- but in general, should be O(n) space (ie if entry values are unbounded)
		- imo: it's more interesting to think of this problem for the case of unbounded entry values; bc then that lets you realize that the 2 pointer method below is strictly better

# Two pointer (best)
```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            curSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]

            if curSum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif curSum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
```

- todo
	- prove why this works: ie why ignored combos never had a chance to sum to target
		- should be similar in flavor to the 'area of water' problem, see [11. Container With Most Water](11.%20Container%20With%20Most%20Water.md)
- complexity
	- O(n) time
	- O(1) space
