```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
	    
```

# Description

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return _the minimum number of conference rooms required_.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`  
**Output:** `2`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]`  
**Output:** `1`  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`

#greedy/interval_cover 
- [[../_secondary/01 competitive programming/halim1.pdf#page=188&selection=49,0,71,83|halim1, page 188]]
	- apparently uses an idea similar to #greedy/sweep_line 
- this problem is not interval cover, but i definitely should find a fundy for it

- the ‘pre-compute’ approaches…are they actually #greedy/sweep_line 
	- if so…is it like the most basic version?
	- is it too basic for sweep line? 
		- ie #/meta: sometimes an example is just way too trivial to help understand a concept


#greedy/priority_queue 
- is the pq solution below, of the same flavor as the ‘greedy via pq classic example’ explained by halim?
	- if not..i’ll need to figure out correct tag

	- remember: consider if pre-processing can help
	- esp: sorting or priority queue!!
		- when to use which?
	- maybe #/fundy:
		- use priority queue to sort (dynamic) input data!
			- and i think 'dynamic' means: after you visit an element: instead of never having to consider it again; we instead modify it and still consider it

### pre-compute changes

- apparently aka: ‘sweep line’
	- https://leetcode.ca/2016-08-09-253-Meeting-Rooms-II/
	- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/253


- strat
	- iterate through intervals
		- create/update structure for ‘changes in currActive’ indexed by timesteps
	- iterate through changes (sorted wrt timesteps)
		- track currActive and maxActive rooms


- the structure you use to store ‘changes indexed by timesteps’ actually matters
	- main choices are:
		- array (sized to max range of times)
		- dictionary (size up to `2*numIntervals)`
			- bc observe: only timesteps that actually have changes are the intervals bounds
			- ie only timesteps that actually ‘matter’ are when ’events’ (start, ends) happen
	- it seems obvious that array will be terrible if num events is way less than max range of times
	- however the subtle benefit of array (though likely not enough of a benefit):
		- timesteps are already sorted
		- aka we just do a linear pass through the array
		- versus if we use dict: we will need to sort by keys



- if we use dict:
	- no real difference compared to ‘pre-compute events’ strat, see below
		- for both methods:
			- we iterate over intervals to create a structure
			- then we iterate over our structure
	- actually this method seems better (but not asymptotically) bc:
		- num of unique ‘important’ timesteps is strictly less than num unique events
			- bc there may be events that share timesteps
		- this method also slightly easier to code / more obviously correct bc if we ‘compute events’:
			- need to be careful about the fact that meeting times should be treated as ‘open intervals’

### pre-compute events

- essentially same idea as pre-compute changes


- strat
	- iterate over intervals
		- create structure(s) of events, sorted by timestep
	- iterate through events
		- track currActive and maxActive rooms


- so strategy:
	- just sort the ‘events’ from earliest to latest
	- now as we iterate through events:
		- if event is a start: increase activeRooms
		- if event is an end: decrease activeRooms
- 2 ways to implement:
	- separately sort and iterate through starts and ends 
	- or combine starts and ends in the same sorted structure
		- see neetcode repo

- !note: meetings are treated as open intervals
	- ie if a meeting starts at same timestep as another meeting ends:
		- they can use same room
	- this means that in implementation, you either:
		- process end times before start times
		- increase activeRooms wrt strict inequality (not weak)



```python
# separate starts and ends (neetcode vid; sean)


# (combine starts and ends) neetcode repo
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        time = []
        for start, end in intervals:
            time.append((start, 1))
            time.append((end, -1))
        
        time.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        for t in time:
            count += t[1]
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
        return max_count

```




## #greedy/priority_queue 

- complexity
	- let `k` be solution
	- worse time bc:
		- O(n log n) to sort intervals
		- then as we iterate through intervals:
			- non-trivial time complexity from updating heap
	- best space
		- sorting intervals wrt start can be done in place
		- we only need structure for heap
			- heap only grows to size `k`
- main idea:
	- use a heap to model rooms that needed to be created
- strat
	- sort intervals by start
	- minheap stores ends of intervals we’ve visited
	- for each interval:
		- if top of heap is an earlier time, then there is a free room
			- so pushpop
		- if not: then we need to create another room
			- so push
	- answer will just be the size of the heap after iterating through all intervals
		- alternatiely, can just have a counter that increments every time a new room needs to be created
			- aka: counter just tracks size of heap
