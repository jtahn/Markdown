[309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `prices = [1,2,3,0,2]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]`  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `prices = [1]`  
**Output:** `0`

**Constraints:**  
- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

# #/todo


## stock variants
- imo i should do all the buy/sell stock variants
	- feels like it'll help me have a much more solid understanding of subtleties in dp techniques
	- and these will all likely cite/backlink fundies for each other
	- i already have:
		- [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]]
	- i should add
		- [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)
			- wording is a little odd
				- you'd never buy and sell on the same day
			- so the only real diff is that you can do buy/sell multiple times
			- this is just a simpler versino of the current problem 309
		- [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)
			- the wording is odd, so add an errata footnote
			- they just mean: you can trade at most 2 stocks (and not simultaneously)
		- [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)
			- yea here they define what is meant by 'transactions'
			- this is in EPI
- so the order of difficulty will probly be:
	- I, II, cooldown, III, IV

- imo: do the same with other 'famous problems'
	- ie if they have 'next problems', do those
		- ie coin change; word search


rly quick, brief skim/summary of the other problems so i can see the fundies:
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/122
	- nvm...this doesn't have any required dp technique
	- it's just greedy: if there is increase in price, then you buy+sell
	- note: even if the problem said you can't 'buy and sell' on the same day:
		- this same solution still works
		- bc buy/sell or sell/buy same day is same as 'doing nothing'
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/123
	- this uses dp to track `2 * 2 = 4` states
- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/188
	- - [DP 38. Buy and Stock Sell IV | Recursion to Space Optimisation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV1dHbk5CDc)
	- uses dp to track essentially `2 * k` states



## fundy?
- seems like a diff implementation, rather than diff strat
- 'differences' array
	- https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/solutions/761720/python-dp-o-n-solution-using-differences-explained/
	- idk if this is worth adding?


## meta
- definitely still make a pass through lc solutions
	- ppl do have interesting ideas that are not in neetcode/algomonster/etc
		- and more specific than stuff in skiena/etc (naturally, bc those textbooks are alrdy so big bc they have to cover all the fundamentals; they can't really do the smaller stuff...it's also just out of scope...bc these 'smaller things' are more like 'problem solving techniques', ie polya)
	- it's just the writeups generally aren't that great
	- and i want to reformulate them anyways to connect/link them with my writeups
	- remember: use it as a way to discover fundies, or clarify fundies i already have
		- not really trying to make my solutions 'fully comprehensive': ie mainly focus on filling out the optimal solution
		- only mention enough of other solutions so that i can understand why the optimal solution is optimal here; ie what structure allows for the optimal tecnique



## add 'storing actions' strat

- btw: i bet there's a way to also solve this problem by assigning storage to 'actions'...
	- so maybe have code for that too
	- but point is, it seems the 'states' will be better for future problems...
		- if so, figure out why
		- aka it will be good comparison/understanding to see how implementation/strat changes if you try to store stuff based on 'actions'




# References


## #dynamic_programming/bottom-up 

- summary
	- one of the main benefits of bottom-up:
		- often have space optimizations, bc you don't actually need to store all solns to smaller subproblems to solve larger subproblems



- #/cleanup there is an idea/ideas here, i'm just not stating it correctly...
	- basically there's a reason/reasons why we don't have to store a massive decision tree
	- ie why today's best value for each action/state, basically depends on almost nothing from the past


- initially seems like the 'decision tree' is massive: bc have up to 2 options each day
	- ie up to `2^n` possible transaction logs

- however observe:
	- the decision of whether to buy/sell:
		- purely based on whether i currently own the stock or not
		- is not based on any of the past transactions except the most recent one
			- aka the storage of past info can be very lightweight
		- it does ultimately depend on prices that occur on later days...but this will be handled by dp/dfs/etc



- point is that:
	- future decision to sell a stock:
		- all that matters is that i own the stock
		- so do not need to store anything else other than: best outcome if i am holding the stock
			- aka do not care what price i bought it at
	- and similarly, future decision to buy;
		- and/or hold, or hold notihng

- actually this fundy probly comes after the 'states' fundy...bc it's like an obvious next step
	- ie once you decide to store states:
		- then you realize that updating states at each time step, doesn't require much prev info
	- idk if this should even be a separate fundy...it's just continuing the same idea
	- this is more just like:
		- a continuation of general observation of dp:
			- one of the benefits of 'bottom-up' is that you realize you don't need to store all subproblems
			- #/todo i saved a bunch of onetab stuff about this...go put it into one of these problems
		- so maybe this should just reference a 'bottom-up' fundy





# Results


## #dynamic_programming/states 

- meta
	- i think this idea of tracking 'states' is a dp specific thing
	- point of dp is storing info about the past
	- and so this fundy is just saying:
		- when trying to figure out what to store:
			- maybe focus on states, not actions


- store states, not actions
- how the states change: does depend on actions + past states
- but ultimately, only thing you actually store are states




- main observation 1:
	- instead of: 'what are the outcomes if we buy/sell/nothing today?'
	- do: 'what are the (best) outcomes if we own the stock today or not?'



- note: at what point do i determine what the state is for the day?
	- i think obvi answer is just, 'end of the day' (ie after buy/sells/hold decisions have ocurred)


- main observation 2:
	- Given the cooldown rule, the problem needs a different state management rule, ensuring that actions taken on a given day are informed by not just the previous (-1) day but also by two days (-2) prior because of the cooldown constraint.
	- to analyze best outcome if we hold a stock today: 
		- pick max of:
			- own because we held yesterday, and did not sell today
			- own because we bought today
				- because of cooldown:
					- means we held nothing (aka sold) at least 2 days ago
	- to analyze if we hold nothing today:
		- pick max of:
			- carry over nothing from yesterday
			- sell today (so we held yesterday)
	- this means need to save 3 states:
		- nothing 2 days ago
		- nothing yesterday
		- held yesterday



- attempt to explain via variables/notation
	- then this means that the states have the following decisions:
		- f = hold a stock
			- carry over prev val of f
			- or buy today: (subtract todays stock price from g from 2 DAYS AGO)
				- 2 days ago is important
		- g = have no stock: max over
			- either sell today (so add todays stock to prev val of f)
			- or continue having no stock (carry over prev val of g)


- the above is exactly what the algo monster code is doing
	- they just explain it incorrectly/terribly lol imo




- also some algos seem to use a var to store whether we're on cd?
	- or similarly, using a buy/sell var
	- so i bet this is like tracking another state





# Strategies


## top-down dp on states
- O(n) space
- actually stores too much, see O(1) below
- implementations
	- neetcode
		- also
			- https://leetcodethehardway.com/solutions/0300-0399/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown-medium
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7j0F7AHpb8&list=PLPe9IkX86X3y5m_MvtNu2ughxsvkqUNKr&index=114
			- looking at the code: this looks like top-down


```python
# neetcode
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # State: Buying or Selling?
        # If Buy -> i + 1
        # If Sell -> i + 2

        dp = {}  # key=(i, buying) val=max_profit

        def dfs(i, buying):
            if i >= len(prices):
                return 0
            if (i, buying) in dp:
                return dp[(i, buying)]

            cooldown = dfs(i + 1, buying)
            if buying:
                buy = dfs(i + 1, not buying) - prices[i]
                dp[(i, buying)] = max(buy, cooldown)
            else:
                sell = dfs(i + 2, not buying) + prices[i]
                dp[(i, buying)] = max(sell, cooldown)
            return dp[(i, buying)]

        return dfs(0, True)


```
