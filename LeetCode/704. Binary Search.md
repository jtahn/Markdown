[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
```

# Description
Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** 9 exists in `nums` and its index is 4  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** 2 does not exist in `nums` so return -1  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## #errors/overflow 
- what this error is
- it's not an issue in python
- but it's an issue for other languages
- how to deal with this (via: l + (r-l)/2)

- not an issue in python
- but in other languages, need to be careful of overflow errors
- aka use `i + (j-1)//2` instead of `(i + j) // 2`
	- is this now computing the ceiling of (i+j)/2 ???

## #binary-search template
- figure out the 'very general binary search' template
	- basicaly i feel like general template/process here is like:
		- you have an array: what half of the array do you want to pick
			- (ie the side with the solution)
			- (diagrams might help here)
			- depending on the problem, might be easier to answer: what does this half 'look' like (on the diagram)
		- how do you phrase the above in terms of relationships with left, mid, and right
		- (might not always exist): is there a way to quickly determine if mid is the solution?
			- not that important, bc iirc (ref a source) the 3 case variant only speeds up computations by the equivalent of 1 iteration
- todo: pull from other discussions of binary search
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Algorithm
		- 'alternative procedure'
		- 'duplicate elements'
		- 'implementation issues'
	- knuth's taocp
	- that 'binary search template' post on the leetcode forums


- strategy
	- compare an element in the middle of the array with the target value  
	- If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned  
	- If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array 
	- If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.  
- diagram: `[i .... m-1] [m] [m+1 ...... j]`
	- so either return m or adjust i or j



- python module: bisect

## returning mid
## 2 vs 3 cases

## exit conditions
- strict vs weak inequality

## examining base cases (2 element array)
- i highly suspect: this is the standard way to debug 'infinite loops' in a binary search algo

- why there is no infinite loop
	- eventually, we get to a singleton array `[i]`
		- (ACTULLY: i think you want the base case to be 2 elements; not a singleton)
	- in this case, `i=j=m`; so if we still haven't found target, then we will get `i>j` and we break out of the loop


- debugging
	- if there is an infinite loop; inspect a very small case, and see if you might permanently stuck in it; in particular, check the size 2 case: `[i   j]`
		- one time i coded it, and i realized i was permanently stuck in this array





# Implementations

## 2 cases, strict inequality
## 2 cases, weak inequality

## 3 cases, strict inequality

## 3 cases, weak inequality
```
def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    i = 0
    j = len(nums)-1
    while i<=j:
        m = (i+j)//2
        if target == nums[m]:
            return m
        elif target < nums[m]:
            j = m-1
        else:
            i = m+1
    return -1
```

# todo/scratch

- note `L<=R` while condition seems to require 3 cases, while `L<R` condition is 2 cases?
	- actually it doesn't...see [875. Koko Eating Bananas](875.%20Koko%20Eating%20Bananas.md)
		- see the 'explanation/general template discussion' i linked below...i think `L<=R` vs `L<R` relates more to how you plan to increment/adjust mid based on L and R

- but note: 2 vs 3 cases is NOT always interchangeable. see:

- todo: figure out how to be careful you dont get stuck in an infinite loop if your while condition is `L<=R`
	- there should be like a general discussion/explanation about this somewhere


seems i should just never use L<=R...that has potential to do infinite loops

> I have a tip. Always use l < r as the while loop condition, and you can return l as the answer if you exit the loop. If you do l=m+1 or r=m-1 it won't cause an issue because search space is being decreased each iteration. If you use r=m it still won't cause an issue because when you do m =(l+r)/2, m will never be r because of the while loop condition. Only issue comes when doing l=m and the issue comes when search space becomes just 2 elements then m becomes equal to l and enters an infinite loop. In that case you add some extra logic to decide whether m is the answer or l = m+1.
> One good example of this I had found was search in a rotated sorted array, do check it out.


> I mostly use the left < right check, so whenever the while loop would break left would be equal to right. Then add an additional check if clause.. if answer needs to be updated for the left = right case. I find it the easiest to visualise.
