[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** 9 exists in `nums` and its index is 4  

**Example 2:**  
**Input:** `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** 2 does not exist in `nums` so return -1  

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

# Binary search
```
def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    i = 0
    j = len(nums)-1
    while i<=j:
        m = (i+j)//2
        if target == nums[m]:
            return m
        elif target < nums[m]:
            j = m-1
        else:
            i = m+1
    return -1
```

- strategy
	- compare an element in the middle of the array with the target value  
	- If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned  
	- If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array 
	- If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.  
- diagram: `[i .... m-1] [m] [m+1 ...... j]`
	- so either return m or adjust i or j
- mention
	- not necessary in python, but in other languages, need to be careful of overflow errors
	- aka use `i + (j-1)//2` instead of `(i + j) // 2`
		- is this now computing the ceiling of (i+j)/2 ???
- why there is no infinite loop
	- eventually, we get to a singleton array `[i]`
	- in this case, `i=j=m`; so if we still haven't found target, then we will get `i>j` and we break out of the loop
- debugging
	- if there is an infinite loop; inspect a very small case, and see if you might permanently stuck in it; in particular, check the size 2 case: `[i   j]`
		- one time i coded it, and i realized i was permanently stuck in this array
