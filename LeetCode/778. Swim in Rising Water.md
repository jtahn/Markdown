[778. Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/)

```python
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
```

# Description

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`.[^1] You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square_ `(n - 1, n - 1)` _if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

[^1]: Errata: The description here is poor. The spirit of the problem is that as time goes on, the elevation of low ground is raised. So imo a more accurate/sensible way to describe the scenario is: we are on an island that sinks by 1 elevation for every time tick. Furthermore, the description implies that at time `t`, we can travel through blocks that are height `t`, so an elevation of 0 is considered 'submerged/swimmable'. 

**Example 1:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240418141355.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).  
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.  
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.  
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.  

**Example 2:**  
![](!assets/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240418141406.png)  
**Input:** `grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]`  
**Output:** `16`  
**Explanation:** The final route is shown.  
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.  

**Constraints:**
- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.

## constrained #graphs/shortest_path: min vertex weight
- maybe solve+cite leetcode problem "Path with Minimum Effort"
	- [1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/)
- bc this problem is just:
	- find the path which has lowest maximum cell value.


- solution is: common #graphs/dijkstra variant
- iirc skiena/clrs discussed this
- find the path that with minimum 'weight' ocurrence
	- ie not cumulative weight
- the point is that in this problem:
	- we can swim infinite distances during a timestep
	- this means that the 'bottleneck' in any path is just the point of highest elevation
	- ie the moment that point is submerged, then we can travel the whole path
	- so we just want to find the path with minimum "max elevation"
