# markdown structure: possible changes
- can i add code lines to code snippets?
- best way to add diagrams?
	- you can drag and drop local gif files into obsidian (check if i can drag straight from browser; probly not though); they automatically will get moved to attachments folder + linked there; then they show up on github markdown viewer, and also in the anki card embedding! 
	- making gifs:
		- * [Make an animated GIF from a slide show - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-an-animated-gif-from-a-slide-show-a598753e-92de-4f1b-8393-714db4d334b4)
		- seems google slides doesn't have this functionality...so you could create in gslides, then open in ppt
			- https://www.howtogeek.com/832437/how-to-convert-google-slides-to-video-or-gif/
	- alternative (that seems worse, but maybe could be useful to be aware of)
		- you can share a link to a google slides prez that auto plays/loops it 
		- ie https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ-Oy-oQ0i4CvWbo8gf9-v42gVOb5gS76sJvhG7jqIntQV7R1dDG3tS7YUhRiPqYXBCjqCcVsJUeZjG/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=1500&slide=id.gbc95359713_0_384
		- * [Make Google Docs, Sheets, Slides & Forms public - Computer - Google Docs Editors Help](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#)
			- can get an embed link

# anki card changes
- the js embedding needs to also replace the 'directory' field; and then i add leetcode directory to all my leetcode cards

# general card structure/content reminders
- it's fine to leave a todo list for later
	- get stuff down in a state where, it won't be a headache to resume where i stopped
	- if revising is difficult (ie idk how to word things properly; or i can't really figure out the 'big idea'): just means i don't have the background/connections to make yet
		- it's just inefficient to spend an hour trying to figure it out: the explanation will eventually appear somewhere else (ie clrs; stackexchange; solution to another problem)
			- i have too much stuff to cover atm, i need to prepare for swe and quant interviews
	- so just come back later, when i've done more reviews; eventually, i'll have the bg/cnxns
- add the function prototype to every card, right under the link
- add descriptors 
- discussions of 'fundamental techniques'
	- remove from cards where this is just 1 step of the approach
		- ie [347. Top K Frequent Elements](LeetCode/347.%20Top%20K%20Frequent%20Elements.md)
	- add reference to cards where the 'fundamental technique' is the entire approach; ie exactly solved by these fundamental techniques
	- examples
		- [703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](LeetCode/703.%20Kth%20Largest%20Element%20in%20a%20Stream.md)
			- heaps
		- [704. Binary Search](LeetCode/704.%20Binary%20Search.md)
			- 2 vs 3 cases
			- while loop condition allowing equality or not
		- [242. Valid Anagram](LeetCode/242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md) will contain discussions on:
			- counting
			- (a lot of this covered by realpython article on Counter class)
			- choice of what python structure to use for counting
				- dict (and the 2 typical ways ppl handle absent keys)
				- default dict
				- Counter
			- how to compare hash structures
				- cover the built-in ops/commands
					- ie `&` operator for Counter
				- optimizations:
					- construct structure as you pass through 1 item; then decrement counts as you pass through another
					- using a variable to store total counts, so you dont have to iterate through entire hashmap every time to compare 
						- 2 ways here too:
							- store how many 'letters of alphabet have the correct count'
							- store total letters we are correct with (and so we have success when total letter matches length of whatever we're trying to find/match)
