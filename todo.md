# organization and clean-up
- modify the markdown cards
	- the js embedding needs to also replace the 'directory' field; and then i add leetcode directory to all my leetcode cards

- whatever is next on neetcode 150 (https://neetcode.io/practice)
	- meta: workflow
		- draft a skeleton + dump screenies/etc for the solutions
			- watch the vid https://neetcode.io/practice
			- look it up on reliable sources for the 'best solution'
				- https://leetcodethehardway.com/
				- https://algo.monster/liteproblems/424
			- then check leetcode forum solutions for other possible methods and clean explanations
		- clean it up a bit
		- once it's clean enough
			- unsuspend card in anki
			- add to toc in the readme

# meta
- always keep the list in order of urgency
- examples of todo items
	- calc explanation
	- anki
		- backlog for reviews
		- revision ideas after review (check voice memos/notebook for edits)
		- blurbs that i think would be helpful for swe/leetcode interviews
		- leetcode
			- "i don't understand the main solutions; aka either the 'simple inefficient' ones and/or the 'important efficient' ones"
			- "don't understand a qualitatively different technique (but probly not urgent bc it's not strictly better)"
		- extremely rough cards that i understand the material, and have all the prose there; but are written very sloppily
		- future cards that i (just) have a skeleton for
