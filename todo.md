# organization and clean-up
- modify the markdown cards
	- the js embedding needs to also replace the 'directory' field; and then i add leetcode directory to all my leetcode cards
- add the function prototype to every card, right under the link

			- this one is related to [739. Daily Temperatures](LeetCode/739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md)
			- imo it's valuable bc it highlights why [739. Daily Temperatures](LeetCode/739.%20Daily%20Temperatures.md) has 2 optimal solutions instead of just 1...it's bc the possible temps are a finite set

# meta
- always keep the list in order of urgency
- examples of todo items
	- calc explanation
	- anki
		- backlog for reviews
		- revision ideas after review (check voice memos/notebook for edits)
		- blurbs that i think would be helpful for swe/leetcode interviews
		- leetcode
			- "i don't understand the main solutions; aka either the 'simple inefficient' ones and/or the 'important efficient' ones"
			- "don't understand a qualitatively different technique (but probly not urgent bc it's not strictly better)"
		- extremely rough cards that i understand the material, and have all the prose there; but are written very sloppily
		- future cards that i (just) have a skeleton for
