- as i read through solution: in my head, talk as if i'm presenting it
	- so when i see a 'reference' to a fundamental problem:
	- probly brownie points for when i actually present a solution:
		- if there is a step of the solution where a 'standard fundamental technique' exists:
			- mention that there's various techniques to use here, and maybe briefly describe them
			- then ask interview if i can use the 'optimal fundamental technique'
				- if they say no, nbd, i can do the more elementary way
				- and i still score brownie pts bc i'm aware of 'optimal ways'


- the explanation should flow correctly
	- should be smooth explanation for why something is the best technique here
	- don't need 'inspiration' for the idea
	- but i need to smoothly explain what tradeoffs are
	- again: just trying to have awareness of techniques, and when to use them; not pretending i can invent techniques
