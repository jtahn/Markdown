- purpose
	- when arguing about complexity (usually time) of a technique, often repeat the same args
- summary
	- "check all pairs" is $O(n^2)$ time
	- DFS on a matrix is $O(nm)$ time where $n,m$ are lengths of the sides

# check all pairs

All pairs is: $$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)$$â€Š

Which is why 'checking all pairs' is time O(n^2)
