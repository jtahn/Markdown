# why this doc
this is a wip...because i don't even know if this document should/can exist

ie atm, i think the main way to 'learn' how to problem solve, is to just review/do as many problems as possible, and hope the brain will inductively/indirectly make connections about patterns/techniques, and make steps feel smaller



# problems that made me think about the big picture
(aka go look into these problems for meta / big picture discussions)

- [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](../LeetCode/84.%20Largest%20Rectangle%20in%20Histogram.md)
- [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](../LeetCode/153.%20Find%20Minimum%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md)
	- raised a lot of subtle points about binary search (ie when we can use 2 vs 3 cases); some of those points are in [704. Binary Search](../LeetCode/704.%20Binary%20Search.md) as well
