# purpose
- a note has assorted idea/thought of a 'concepts' i'm looking to cover
- i can keep polishing this note over time
- but tbh ideally: at some point i encounter the concepts in a textbook; so then i just add a reading card from that textbook pages; and then delete my blurb if it isn't really saying anything new..or maybe keep the blurb if it's really polished / i do think it's making connections or providing an overview that is worth keeping in one place/file
	- in particular: sometimes, it's true that the entire content of the blurb is likely scattered across the reading cards i already have; but there isn't a source that compiles/connects all those parts together, and it might be very important for me to know that connection; and this concept involves things that are scattered enough, that it might not be immediate for me to make the connections (but there are situations where it's important for me to make the connections immediately)
	- so in this case: have a reading card that is essentially about, stating this connection very explicitly
	- this also means, this kind of card: do not need to go super in depth into the 'background' pieces; ie the background, should have reading cards dedicated to each piece
