# auto-imported modules
- technically on leetcode, you can just do `ceil()` instead of `math.ceil()`, bc the modules are auto-imported in leetcode..ie imagine leetcode has this line at the top of every solution: `from math import *`
- imo i should make it a habit to not only explicitly import modules, but also use their name
	- well maybe dont have to explicitly import; but definitely use the name
	- ie always do math.ceil() instead of just ceil()
