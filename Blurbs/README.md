# ideally: this directory is a just temp placeholder
- ultimately, this directory should be empty
	- i should be able to find a 'fundamental problem' where a blurb's discussion can be put into
		- ie the entire solution to this problem, essentially revolves around exactly understanding that is targeted by this discussion
		- once i find this: then add it to my 'index of foundational/fundamental techniques'
		- ie python modules: there's often a problem that this module most directly solves
			- exampls
				- bisect: [704. Binary Search](../LeetCode/704.%20Binary%20Search.md)
				- heapq: [703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](../LeetCode/703.%20Kth%20Largest%20Element%20in%20a%20Stream.md)
	- any kind of discussion:
		- there's surely some kind of application
		- which surely is the 'entire/fundamental' answer to a question
		- so i just need to find that 'fundamental question'
			- ideally, phrased like a question i'd actually be asked in an interview
				- even better: exact examples of questions that are asked in interviews
				- bc atm, swe/quant interviews are the highest priority
				- later, 'job performance' might be come highest priority, and so then questions i might try to phrase as 'situations that have come up during ppl's job work' as well
		- until then: can just leave the discussion in this directory as a blurb
		- repeatedly re-reading zotero is a lower priority
			- mainly helps/triggers awareness if i have a misunderstanding about how i'm explaining something
				- ie using incorrect jargon
				- also a source for my writeups for discussions on the fundamental techniques
					- btw add them as references







# purpose
- a note has assorted idea/thought of a 'concepts' i'm looking to cover
- i can keep polishing this note over time
- but tbh ideally: at some point i encounter the concepts in a textbook; so then i just add a reading card from that textbook pages; and then delete my blurb if it isn't really saying anything new..or maybe keep the blurb if it's really polished / i do think it's making connections or providing an overview that is worth keeping in one place/file
	- in particular: sometimes, it's true that the entire content of the blurb is likely scattered across the reading cards i already have; but there isn't a source that compiles/connects all those parts together, and it might be very important for me to know that connection; and this concept involves things that are scattered enough, that it might not be immediate for me to make the connections (but there are situations where it's important for me to make the connections immediately)
	- so in this case: have a reading card that is essentially about, stating this connection very explicitly
	- this also means, this kind of card: do not need to go super in depth into the 'background' pieces; ie the background, should have reading cards dedicated to each piece





# possible directory names
- blurbs
	- [Expository papers by K. Conrad](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/)
- connections
	- since these files are basically only about 'connections'/like connecting a bunch of stuff together
